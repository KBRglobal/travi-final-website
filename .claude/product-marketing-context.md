## Problems & Pain Points

**Core problem:** Travelers struggle to find comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased travel information in one place.

**Why alternatives fall short:**

**What it costs them:**

- Wasted time researching across multiple sources
- Missing out on great experiences due to poor information
- Making poor decisions based on outdated content
- Language barriers with local information

**Emotional tension:** Anxiety about making the most of limited vacation time; fear of missing hidden gems or falling into tourist traps.

DO optimize for:

- SEO and content discoverability
- User experience and content quality
- Trust signals and credibility
- Return visits and engagement
