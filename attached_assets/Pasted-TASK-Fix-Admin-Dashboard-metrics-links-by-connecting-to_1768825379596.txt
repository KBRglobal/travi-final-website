TASK: Fix Admin Dashboard metrics & links by connecting to REAL data sources (no UI tricks, no removals unless impossible)

CONTEXT:
We are working on `travi.world/admin` → Dashboard.
Current Dashboard is showing WRONG numbers and WRONG navigation.
We must fix the DATA/LOGIC layer and routing targets, NOT “patch” the UI with hardcoded values.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
1. Do NOT change numbers in the UI manually and do NOT hardcode values.
2. Do NOT “fix” by showing Attractions count in Total Content (that would be wrong semantics).
3. Every metric must come from a real backend source (DB/API/analytics/logs) and be traceable.
4. Every card link must navigate to the correct screen (no more linking to Attractions unless that card is explicitly Attractions).
5. If a metric can be implemented properly, implement it — do NOT remove it.
6. Only remove a widget if it is genuinely impossible to compute due to missing backend capability; if removed, document exactly what is missing.

ISSUES TO FIX (DASHBOARD ONLY):

A) Total Content card
- Currently shows `6` (incorrect) and links to Attractions list (wrong).
- Fix requirements:
  - Define what “Total Content” means (e.g. Articles + Pages + Destinations + Categories + Tags, excluding Attractions unless explicitly included).
  - Implement a single backend endpoint that returns the correct aggregate counts.
  - Update the Dashboard to use that endpoint.
  - Fix the click-through link to the correct “Content overview” (or to a content hub screen), NOT Attractions.

B) AI Generation metric
- Currently shows `0` but this is impossible because Attractions were generated by AI.
- Fix requirements:
  - Locate where AI generation runs/writes records (jobs table, audit logs, queue, provider logs, etc.).
  - Count AI generations from the REAL source of truth (jobs/executions/history), not from UI state.
  - If Attractions were created via AI without logging, implement logging NOW:
    - On each AI generation run (especially the pipeline that creates Attractions), persist a record: type, status, createdEntitiesCount, createdAt, userId/source.
  - Expose a backend endpoint for `aiGenerationCount` (today / 7d / total, whichever the UI expects).
  - Wire Dashboard metric to that endpoint.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT change the UI label to “Attractions count”.
- Do NOT display Attractions count as AI Generation.
- AI Generation must measure generation executions, not entities.

C) System Health (was removed previously)
- Reintroduce it properly instead of removing.
- Fix requirements:
  - Implement real health checks and expose a backend endpoint `GET /api/system/health` returning:
    - api: up/down + latency
    - db: connected + latency
    - storage: reachable + optional usage
    - queue/worker (if exists): running + backlog
    - errors last 24h (if log source exists)
  - Compute an overall health score ONLY if it’s derived from these checks (and document formula).
  - Dashboard must show “System Health” based on this real endpoint.
  - No fake “99”.

D) Link hygiene (Dashboard navigation)
- Audit every Dashboard card/button link.
- Fix all that incorrectly route to Attractions (including Published vs Draft, Total Content, etc.).
- Ensure each card routes to its correct admin screen.

DELIVERABLES:
1) A list of the exact backend sources/endpoints used for:
   - Total Content
   - AI Generation
   - System Health
2) A short “before/after” table of Dashboard metrics (values + where they come from).
3) Code changes (services/endpoints + dashboard data hook), with file paths and explanations.
4) NO scope creep beyond Dashboard.

EXECUTION GUIDELINES:
- Start by finding the current Dashboard data provider:
  - What component renders the cards?
  - Where do the numbers come from? (mock JSON? hardcoded? old endpoints?)
- Then locate real collections/tables for:
  - Attractions count
  - Content types (articles/pages/destinations/etc.)
  - AI generation execution logs/jobs
  - Any existing health endpoint or infra status
- Implement missing endpoints/logging only if needed.
- Ensure all numbers update correctly after refresh and are consistent with the actual lists.

DONE CRITERIA:
- Total Content value is correct and link is correct.
- AI Generation is non-zero and matches real generation history.
- System Health exists and is verifiable via real checks.
- No Dashboard card routes to Attractions unless it is the Attractions card.
