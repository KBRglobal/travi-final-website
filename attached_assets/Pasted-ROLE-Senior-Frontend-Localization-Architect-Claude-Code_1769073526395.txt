ROLE: Senior Frontend + Localization Architect (Claude Code)

OBJECTIVE:
Complete FULL localization of all CORE UI PAGES (menu + shell pages) to 30 languages.
This task is NOT content generation and NOT Octypo-related.
This is STRICT UI + UX + i18n correctness work.

SCOPE (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Core pages only (navigation, menu pages, layout pages, system pages)
- NO internal content pages (guides, attractions, articles)
- NO AI content generation
- NO Octypo usage
- Manual, deterministic implementation only

CORE REQUIREMENTS (MUST ALL BE MET):

1. LANGUAGE COVERAGE
- Exactly 30 locales (already defined in project)
- Every locale must fully render ALL core UI pages
- ZERO mixed-language rendering
- ZERO silent fallback to English
- Missing keys must be visible (e.g. [MISSING:key])

2. STRUCTURE & FILE SYSTEM
- Enforce clean locale structure:
  /locales/{locale}/common.json
  /locales/{locale}/navigation.json
  /locales/{locale}/pages.json
- Keys must be IDENTICAL across all locales
- Build must FAIL if any locale is missing keys

3. UI & UX DIRECTIONALITY
- Correct dir handling per locale:
  - RTL: ar, he, fa, ur
  - LTR: all others
- ALL directional UI must flip correctly:
  - Arrows
  - Chevrons
  - Back/Next icons
  - Pagination
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Sliders / carousels
- NO hardcoded left/right logic
- Direction must be derived from locale only

4. NAVIGATION & MENU
- Header menu fully localized
- Footer fully localized
- Mobile menu fully localized
- Language switcher:
  - Shows current language clearly
  - Does NOT reset page context
  - Does NOT force English at any point

5. ROUTING
- Root "/" redirects to "/en"
- "/{locale}" is canonical entry point
- All core pages must exist under:
  /{locale}/...
- hreflang support must be correct for ALL 30 locales

6. SEO FOR CORE PAGES (UI ONLY)
- Localized:
  - <title>
  - meta description
  - og:title
  - og:description
  - og:locale
- No schema/content generation here — UI pages only

7. ICONS & VISUAL CONSISTENCY
- Icons must respect direction automatically
- No duplicated icon sets per locale
- Use logical direction (start/end) instead of left/right

8. QUALITY BAR (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- No hardcoded strings in JSX
- No inline English text
- No TODOs left
- No commented-out logic
- Clean, readable, production-grade code

DELIVERABLES:
- All core UI pages fully localized for 30 languages
- Verified RTL/LTR correctness
- Verified build-time enforcement
- No regressions in existing localization strictness

DO NOT:
- Generate marketing copy
- Rewrite content
- Add new features
- Touch Octypo or AI pipelines

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
I should be able to switch to ANY of the 30 languages and:
- See a 100% localized UI
- Correct direction and icons
- Correct navigation
- Zero English leakage

Proceed step by step, commit-safe, and do not skip verification.
