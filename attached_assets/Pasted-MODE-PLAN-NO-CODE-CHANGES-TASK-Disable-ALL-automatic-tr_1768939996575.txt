MODE: PLAN (NO CODE CHANGES)

TASK: Disable ALL automatic translation & all translation triggers (DeepL is OFF) — keep localization UI/DB only

CONTEXT:
You confirmed: automatic translation is still ACTIVE via publish hooks, manual triggers, RSS auto-process, and a polling queue.
We are moving to: NO-AUTOMATIC-TRANSLATION. Localization must be DB-driven only (manual content entry/import), with ZERO AI translation anywhere in runtime or background.

GOAL:
After this change:
- Publishing content MUST NOT enqueue translation jobs
- Translation worker/queue MUST NOT run or poll
- Any translation API routes MUST be disabled (return 410 or 403)
- Admin UI must NOT expose “Translate/Trigger translation” actions
- DeepL must be impossible to call from server code paths (hard-off)

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1) FIND ALL translation triggers and remove/disable them:
   - server/localization/publish-hooks.ts (enqueue on publish)
   - server/auto-pilot.ts autoTranslateOnPublish
   - RSS auto-translate path in routes (the RSS import path you mentioned)
   - Any cron/scheduler that touches translation queue

2) HARD DISABLE translation execution:
   - translation-queue.ts polling must stop (no setInterval/loop)
   - translation-worker.ts must never execute (guard + log if called)
   - translation-service.ts must not call any provider (DeepL/OpenAI/Claude/etc). Put a single centralized guard that throws “TranslationDisabledError”.

3) DISABLE all translation endpoints:
   - /api/translations/:contentId/translate
   - /api/auto-pilot/translations/:id/trigger
   - /api/auto-pilot/bulk/translate
   - Any other translate endpoints you find
   Return 410 Gone (preferred) or 403 with a clear message.

4) ADMIN UI:
   - Remove buttons/actions that trigger translation
   - Remove any “auto translate on publish” toggles or force them to OFF and hidden

5) VERIFICATION (MUST PROVIDE PROOF):
   - Grep results before/after showing no remaining enqueueTranslation / triggerTranslation calls on publish/RSS paths
   - Create/publish a piece of content and show: ZERO new rows created in translation queue tables
   - Confirm translation worker does not poll (no logs every 5s)
   - Hitting translation endpoints returns 410/403 consistently
   - npm run check passes

DELIVERABLE:
A concise checklist of files changed + proof outputs (commands + results).
No “it should work” language — only verifiable proof.

DO NOT:
- Add any new translation logic
- Add fallback translation
- Change localization rendering behavior
- Touch semantic search / embeddings unless they are used for translation
