ACKNOWLEDGED — PENDING FORMAL ACCEPTANCE

Good. This is the correct direction.
Before I formally accept this fix, I need the following MANDATORY PROOFS.

--------------------------------
REQUIRED PROOFS (NO EXCEPTIONS)
--------------------------------

1) CODE PROOF — WHITELISTS REMOVED

A) public-api.ts
- Show the exact diff or code snippet proving:
  - ALLOWED_DESTINATION_IDS is COMPLETELY removed
  - No equivalent whitelist or hardcoded ID check exists
- Include file path + line numbers

B) destination-intelligence.ts
- Show the exact diff proving:
  - SUPPORTED_DESTINATION_IDS is removed
  - No purge / auto-delete logic based on hardcoded IDs remains
- Include file path + line numbers

I need to see the code, not a description.

--------------------------------
2) SQL PROOF — RAILWAY POSTGRESQL ONLY
--------------------------------

Provide a query result from Railway PostgreSQL showing:

id | slug | is_active
---------------------
test-city | test-city | true

AND total count = 18 destinations.

Explicitly confirm:
- This is Railway (RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL)
- Not Replit / local / cached data

--------------------------------
3) API PROOF
--------------------------------

A) List endpoint:
GET /api/public/destinations
- Response includes test-city
- Total count = 18

B) Single endpoint:
GET /api/public/destinations/test-city
- Status 200
- Returns hero, mood, SEO data

--------------------------------
4) RESTART PERSISTENCE PROOF
--------------------------------

After a server restart:
- test-city still exists in DB
- test-city still appears in API
- test-city is NOT deleted or altered

Provide either:
- Log proof
- Or re-run SQL + API proof post-restart

--------------------------------
5) FRONTEND PROOF
--------------------------------

- /destinations page shows Test City
- /destinations/test-city loads successfully
- Network tab shows API response (no fallback, no static data)

--------------------------------
FINAL ACCEPTANCE RULE
--------------------------------

Once all proofs above are provided and verified:
- I will formally ACCEPT this fix
- We will close the “Create Destination” blocker
- We will then resume:
  Hero Media
  OG
  Schemas

Until then, this task remains OPEN.

Do not proceed to other features yet.
