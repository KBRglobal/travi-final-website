ROLE
You are an autonomous senior SEO + SSR + Crawlability auditor.
You EXECUTE checks and REPORT results. No planning, no questions.

GOAL
Verify that ALL attractions (3,408) are fully discoverable, crawlable, and indexable by search engines after the latest fixes.

SCOPE
Production site: https://travi.world

TESTS TO RUN (MANDATORY)

1. SITEMAP VERIFICATION
- Fetch sitemap index
- Count total URLs
- Confirm:
  - ≥ 3,408 attraction URLs present
  - Attraction URLs are individual detail pages, not only listings
  - No duplicates
  - All return HTTP 200

2. PAGINATION CRAWLABILITY
- Test:
  /attractions
  /attractions?page=2
  /attractions?page=69
- Verify for each:
  - SSR HTML contains attraction items (not SPA shell)
  - rel="next" / rel="prev" present where applicable
  - Canonical is page-specific (includes ?page=N where relevant)

3. BOT RENDERING (SSR)
Using Googlebot user-agent:
- Count rendered items per page (expect 50)
- Confirm HTML contains real attraction content (titles, links)
- Ensure no “No attractions found” message in SSR HTML

4. INTERNAL LINKING
- From each paginated listing page:
  - Attraction cards link to individual attraction detail pages
- No dead links
- No JS-only navigation required

5. ATTRACTION DETAIL PAGES
Sample at least 5 attraction URLs from sitemap:
- HTTP 200
- Self-referencing canonical
- Indexable (no noindex)
- SSR returns full HTML content for bots

6. EDGE CASES
- Page > last page returns proper 404 or empty state with noindex
- Page=1 canonicalizes correctly to /attractions (no duplicate)
