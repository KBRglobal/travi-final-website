TASK: G2-A-05 DESTINATIONS PAGE — HARD VERIFICATION + 30-LOCALE COMPLETION (PLAN ONLY)

CONTEXT:
You marked G2A-05 (Destinations page localization) as complete.
I need strict verification and completion to full Genesis standards:
- 30 locales (not 17)
- Zero hardcoded visible strings
- RTL correctness for ar/he/fa/ur
- No Dubai bias
- No silent fallbacks

IMPORTANT:
Stay in PLAN mode. Do NOT start Build. Output only a task checklist + proofs required.

GOALS:
1) Prove the Destinations page is fully localized (UI + accessibility labels).
2) Ensure all translation keys exist for ALL 30 locales, not just en/ar/he.
3) Ensure RTL visuals are correct and not just dir="rtl".
4) Ensure no remaining literal English strings on the Destinations route.
5) Ensure no wrong namespaces or key collisions.

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES (STRICT):

A) 30-LOCALE COVERAGE MATRIX
- List the 30 supported locales used by the app (source of truth file).
- Confirm the following keys exist in EVERY locale JSON:
  - destinations.hero.ariaLabel
  - destinations.hero.badgeText (with {count})
  - destinations.hero.title.part1/part2/part3 (or whatever exact structure you used)
  - destinations.hero.description
  - destinations.stats.destinations
  - destinations.stats.countries
  - destinations.cta.exploreAll
If any locale is missing, list it explicitly.

B) NO LITERAL STRINGS AUDIT (DESTINATIONS ROUTE)
Run a targeted grep/audit limited to:
- client/src/pages/destinations.tsx
- client/src/components/destinations-hero.tsx (or exact path)
- any hero components used by Destinations
Return the list of remaining string literals that can appear to the user (if any).
The expectation is ZERO.

C) RTL VISUAL & INTERACTION CHECKLIST
For /ar/destinations and /he/destinations:
- Confirm text alignment uses text-start/text-end (no left/right).
- Confirm spacing uses logical padding/margins (ps/pe) where needed.
- Confirm chevrons/arrows are mirrored if present.
- Confirm any carousel/scroll container direction is correct.
If no such UI exists on Destinations, explicitly state “not applicable” and why.

D) NAMESPACE / KEY HYGIENE
- Confirm you used the correct namespace (“common” vs “destinations”) consistently.
- Ensure no accidental cross-page keys (e.g., home.stats.*) remain.
- Provide the final key list you added/modified.

E) ACCEPTANCE TESTS (MANUAL + AUTOMATABLE)
Provide:
1) Manual steps to verify:
   - /destinations (en)
   - /ar/destinations
   - /he/destinations
   - One additional LTR locale (e.g., /fr/destinations)
2) A Playwright test spec proposal (not code yet) to assert:
   - h1 is not English in /ar and /he
   - aria-label is localized
   - button text localized
   - stats labels localized

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- First: “Status: PASS/FAIL” for each section A–E
- Then: A numbered task list to finish missing items
- Do NOT start Build, do NOT modify code in this response

START.
