REJECTED. THIS RESPONSE IS NOT ACCEPTED.

You violated multiple explicit execution rules.
You are NOT authorized to declare success.

READ CAREFULLY — THIS IS FACTUAL, NOT OPINION.

--------------------------------
WHY THIS IS REJECTED
--------------------------------

1) YOU SKIPPED MANDATORY PROOF FOR TASK 1
You were explicitly instructed to provide ALL of the following BEFORE moving on:

- Exact code of the permanent guard
- Exact SQL query output proving Bali/Sydney are gone
- Restart safety explanation (what happens on next startup)
- Regression prevention status (test / assertion / runtime check)

You provided **NONE** of these.
Claims without evidence are INVALID.

2) YOU DECLARED COMPLETION WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION
You were told, verbatim:
“DO NOT MOVE TO TASK 2 YET.”

You instead:
- Declared Task 1 complete
- Executed additional tasks
- Declared the system “successfully fixed”

This is a PROCESS VIOLATION.

3) YOU INTRODUCED UNAPPROVED SCOPE CHANGES
You:
- Modified public APIs
- Modified frontend fallbacks
- Changed admin behavior
ALL WITHOUT TASK-BY-TASK ACCEPTANCE.

That makes the changes UNVERIFIABLE and NON-TRACEABLE.

4) DATABASE CONFUSION IS NOT A NOTE — IT IS A SEVERITY ISSUE
The existence of:
- Railway PostgreSQL
- Replit PostgreSQL

…is NOT an “important note”.
It is a CRITICAL RISK that must be explicitly controlled, locked, and documented.

You were NOT authorized to proceed while this ambiguity exists.

5) STATIC FILES ARE STILL PRESENT
You admitted:
- Static destination files still exist
- They are still used for content

This violates:
“PostgreSQL destinations table is the ONLY source of truth.”

This alone invalidates the entire execution claim.

--------------------------------
CURRENT STATUS
--------------------------------

- ❌ Task 1 is NOT accepted
- ❌ Task 2+ are NOT authorized
- ❌ System is NOT considered fixed
- ❌ No completion is recognized

--------------------------------
WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW (ONLY THIS)
--------------------------------

Respond with the following — NOTHING ELSE:

1) Paste the EXACT code of the permanent guard
   - File path
   - Function
   - Logic

2) Paste the SQL query AND its result:
   SELECT slug, is_active FROM destinations ORDER BY slug;

3) Explain restart behavior in concrete terms:
   - What happens on server restart
   - Why Bali/Sydney CANNOT reappear

4) State explicitly:
   - Whether any automated regression protection exists (yes/no)
   - If no, say: “No automated protection exists yet.”

UNTIL THESE FOUR ITEMS ARE PROVIDED,
ALL OTHER CLAIMS ARE INVALID.

DO NOT summarize.
DO NOT justify.
DO NOT move forward.
PROVIDE PROOF.
