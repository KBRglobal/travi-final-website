TASK: Move “Best Time to Visit” (Seasons / Weather) from hardcoded placeholders to database-backed content – NO UI yet.

CONTEXT:
- This is a long-term content system, not a one-off page.
- Current implementation uses generic placeholder seasons in:
  client/src/data/destinations.ts (genericSeasons)
- Rendered by:
  client/src/components/destination/BestTimeToVisit.tsx
- This placeholder content must NOT remain in production.

GOAL (STEP 1 ONLY):
✅ Move “Best Time to Visit” data to the database
❌ Do NOT build admin UI yet
❌ Do NOT invent fake data
❌ Do NOT over-engineer

REQUIREMENTS:

1️⃣ Database
- Add a new structure for destination seasons (table or JSON column – choose the simplest clean option).
- Each destination can have 0–4 seasons.
- Each season includes:
  - name (Spring / Summer / Fall / Winter)
  - months (string)
  - weatherDescription (string)
  - crowdLevel (low | medium | high)
  - recommendation (string)
- Data must be editable later (design with admin in mind).

2️⃣ Backend / Data Layer
- Expose seasons data as part of destination fetch logic.
- If a destination has NO seasons data → return null / empty array (NO placeholders).

3️⃣ Frontend
- Update BestTimeToVisit.tsx to:
  - Render only if seasons data exists.
  - Gracefully hide the section if no data is available.
- Remove usage of genericSeasons entirely.
- destinations.ts must no longer contain weather/season content.

4️⃣ SEO / AEO
- Use REAL data only (no lorem, no generic text).
- Structure should support future:
  - FAQ answers
  - AI summaries
  - Schema.org integration (not required now, but don’t block it).

5️⃣ Cleanup
- Delete or fully disconnect:
  genericSeasons
- Ensure no dead imports or unused code remain.

6️⃣ Deliverables
At the end, report:
- Where seasons data now lives (DB schema / column)
- What was removed from code
- Confirmation that pages without data do NOT show the section
- No UI added yet

IMPORTANT:
This is STEP 1 of a deeper system.
Do not add admin tabs.
Do not add migrations unrelated to this.
Do not touch other destination sections.

Ask questions ONLY if something blocks execution.
Otherwise – implement.
