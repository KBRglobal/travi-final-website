MODE: PLAN (NO CODE YET)

TASK: Fix Attractions City Pages 404 + Remove Dubai Bias

CONTEXT:
- /attractions (main page) works.
- City category pages like /attractions/paris, /attractions/dubai, /attractions/london currently return 404.
- There is at least one button on /attractions (e.g., "Things to Do in Paris") that links to /attractions/paris, causing broken internal navigation.
- We must show ONLY real data (no fake numbers, no placeholders).
- We must NOT turn the product into a “Dubai site”. Global-first.

GOAL:
Decide and implement the correct architecture for city-level attractions pages so:
1) No internal links point to 404.
2) City-level pages exist and display real, query-driven data OR (if intentionally not supported) all links are removed/redirected safely.
3) No Dubai-hardcoded routing or copy.

DELIVERABLE NOW (PLAN ONLY):
Return a concrete plan with:
A) Truth table: which city-level route pattern is the intended one in the codebase:
   - Option 1: /attractions/[city]
   - Option 2: /attractions/list/[city]
   - Option 3: another existing pattern
Provide evidence from current routes configuration.

B) Decision:
Choose ONE canonical route pattern for city pages and justify it based on existing data sources (e.g., tiqetsAttractions, seoSlug, cityName, published status).

C) Fix Strategy:
- If city pages SHOULD exist:
  1) Define route + page component location
  2) Define API query contract (input slug -> cityName mapping, published-only)
  3) Define empty-state behavior (real “no results”, not placeholders)
  4) Define internal link updates (all buttons/cards/chips must link to canonical route)
  5) Define redirect strategy from legacy paths (301 where applicable)

- If city pages should NOT exist (not in scope):
  1) Identify every UI element linking to /attractions/[city] (buttons, cards, footer, anywhere)
  2) Remove those links or redirect them to /attractions with a query filter (real filtering)
  3) Ensure zero 404 from internal navigation

D) Verification checklist:
- Confirm clicking “Things to Do in Paris” does NOT lead to 404.
- Confirm canonical city page (or filtered /attractions) returns HTTP 200.
- Confirm page displays real attractions (published only).
- Confirm no “Search Dubai” or Dubai-specific hardcoding appears in Attractions flows.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not write code yet.
- Do not change unrelated areas.
- Output the plan in numbered steps with exact file paths you will touch in BUILD mode.
