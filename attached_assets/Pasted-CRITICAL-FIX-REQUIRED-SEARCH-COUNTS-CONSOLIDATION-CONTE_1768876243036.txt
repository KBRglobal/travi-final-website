CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED – SEARCH + COUNTS CONSOLIDATION

CONTEXT:
Post-publish audit shows the site is visually excellent, but two functional issues remain.
Search is BLOCKING UX + SEO. Counts inconsistency hurts credibility.

================================
PRIORITY 1 — SEARCH (BLOCKING)
================================

PROBLEM:
Searching for "paris" (and other cities) returns ZERO results.

ROOT CAUSE (KNOWN):
The search endpoint currently queries ONLY the CMS `contents` table.
City pages and attractions live in:
- destinations table
- tiqets_attractions table

So searching for cities will always fail.

REQUIRED FIX (NO UI HACKS):

1. Extend the search API to include:
   - destinations (by name + slug)
   - tiqets_attractions (by cityName + title)

2. Expected search behavior:
   - Query: "paris"
     → Return:
       - Destination: Paris (/destinations/paris)
       - Attractions list shortcut (/attractions/list/paris)
       - Individual Paris attractions
       - Relevant guides/articles if exist

3. Result types must be clearly typed:
   - destination
   - attraction
   - guide/article

4. No fake results.
   Only real DB data.

DELIVERABLE:
- Search for any city returns meaningful results
- "paris", "rome", "dubai", "tokyo" all work
- Verified via manual test + console log

================================
PRIORITY 2 — DESTINATIONS COUNT (CONSISTENCY)
================================

CURRENT STATE (BROKEN):
Different pages show different destination counts:
16 / 17 / 18

DECISION REQUIRED:
Pick ONE canonical number based on database truth.

RULE:
The number MUST come from the database, not hardcoded text.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Option A (FAST):
- Query COUNT(*) FROM destinations WHERE status='active'
- Use this value everywhere (homepage, stats, footer, destinations page)

Option B (BETTER, IF ALREADY STARTED):
- Centralize via /api/public/stats
- Replace all frontend hardcoded numbers

DELIVERABLE:
- Same destination count everywhere
- No magic numbers in frontend

================================
PRIORITY 3 — NEWS PAGE (LOW)
================================

If there is no published content:
- Hide empty sections completely
OR
- Show ONE clean “Coming soon” block (not multiple empty sections)

NO FAKE CONTENT.

================================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
================================

✓ Search returns results for city names
✓ Destinations count is identical everywhere
✓ No empty/embarrassing UI states
✓ Zero Dubai bias
✓ No regressions

THIS IS THE FINAL POLISH BEFORE SCALE.
FIX IN THIS ORDER.
