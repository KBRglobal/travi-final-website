TASK: PRE-LAUNCH CLEANUP – NAVIGATION, SITEMAP & GUIDES UI

CONTEXT
We are preparing for production launch.
Some sections are incomplete or inconsistent and must be temporarily removed or adjusted.

CURRENT ISSUES
1. /dining – empty page (no data, no UX)
2. /things-to-do – empty page (no data, no UX)
3. /guides – has content but visual style is inconsistent with the rest of the site
4. /news – missing the main top navigation (PublicNav)

GOAL
Ship a clean, consistent, crawl-safe production version.
Only expose sections that are ready.

REQUIRED ACTIONS (IN ORDER)

1. TEMPORARILY DISABLE INCOMPLETE SECTIONS
- Remove /dining and /things-to-do from:
  - Main navigation (PublicNav)
  - Footer links
  - XML sitemap
  - Any internal links
- Do NOT delete code or routes – only hide/exclude them
- Add a TODO comment for future re-enable

2. GUIDES PAGE DESIGN ALIGNMENT (/guides)
- Keep content and structure
- Fix visual inconsistencies to match the rest of the site:
  - Background: match standard light theme (no heavy dark overlays)
  - Typography: same font scale, weights, and colors as /destinations & /attractions
  - Buttons: use primary / secondary button styles used elsewhere
  - Remove experimental gradients / effects that don’t exist on other pages
- Goal: Guides should feel like a first-class page, not a separate product

3. NEWS PAGE NAVIGATION
- Add the standard <PublicNav /> to /news
- Ensure active menu state works correctly
- Footer already exists – only top nav is missing

4. SITEMAP UPDATE
- Remove:
  - /dining
  - /things-to-do
- Keep:
  - /destinations
  - /hotels
  - /attractions
  - /guides
  - /news
- Verify sitemap builds without warnings

5. FINAL VERIFICATION
- Manual check:
  - No dead links in nav
  - No empty pages accessible
  - Visual consistency across main sections
- Do NOT add new features
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code

DELIVERABLE
- One clean commit
- Short summary of what was removed vs. fixed
- Confirmation that site is ready for publish

IMPORTANT
This is a polish + scope-control task, not new development.
Speed and correctness over perfection.
