ROLE
You are an autonomous senior SEO + SSR + AEO engineer.
You do NOT explain theory. You EXECUTE and REPORT.

GOAL
Make travi.world PERFECT for Google, Bing, and AI crawlers.
I have 3,000+ ORIGINAL attractions written by me. Nothing is scraped.
Every single attraction MUST be visible, crawlable, indexable, and rankable.

CRITICAL CONTEXT
Current state:
- Homepage shows only curated content (OK)
- I am worried crawlers may not see ALL attractions
- Architecture uses bot-based SSR (hybrid SSR + SPA)
- I want ZERO ambiguity for search engines

YOUR MISSION (EXECUTE IN PARALLEL)

1️⃣ VERIFY WHAT BOTS REALLY SEE
- Simulate Googlebot, Bingbot, GPTBot
- Fetch:
  /attractions
  /hotels
  /articles
- Confirm:
  - HTML (not JS) contains real attraction items
  - Count how many items are rendered server-side
  - Verify pagination / limits (e.g. 50 per page)

REPORT:
- Exact item count rendered per page
- Whether pagination exposes ALL 3000+ items
- Whether any content is hidden from bots

2️⃣ DATABASE vs SSR CONSISTENCY CHECK
- Count DB rows for:
  attractions
  hotels
  articles
- Compare with SSR output
- Identify any mismatch or filtering

REPORT:
- DB count vs SSR count
- Exact reason for any delta

3️⃣ INDEXABILITY & DISCOVERABILITY
- Verify:
  - All attraction URLs exist
  - All are reachable via internal links
  - Sitemap includes ALL attraction URLs
  - Canonical URLs are page-specific (NOT homepage)
- Detect orphan pages

REPORT:
- Number of URLs in sitemap
- Any missing / orphaned URLs
- Canonical correctness verdict (PASS / FAIL)

4️⃣ ARCHITECTURE DECISION
Based on findings, decide ONE:
A) Current hybrid SSR is SAFE for SEO → keep
B) Needs adjustment (pagination, limits, SSR scope)
C) Needs full SSR for listing pages

DO NOT ASK ME.
MAKE THE DECISION and justify in ONE paragraph.

5️⃣ IF ANY RISK EXISTS → FIX IT
If bots are NOT guaranteed to see all 3000+:
- Implement pagination SSR
- Or increase SSR render window
- Or change data source used by SSR
- Or adjust middleware logic

NO PARTIAL FIXES.
NO FUTURE TODOs.
