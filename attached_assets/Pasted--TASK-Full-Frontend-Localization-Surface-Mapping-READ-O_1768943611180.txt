TASK: Full Frontend Localization Surface Mapping (READ-ONLY)

GOAL
Create a complete, exhaustive map of all public frontend pages and their content zones, to prepare for full localization (Genesis phase).
This task is analysis only — do NOT modify code, schemas, APIs, or configs.

⸻

1️⃣ PAGE INVENTORY (ROUTES)

Produce a definitive list of all public-facing frontend routes, grouped by type:
	•	Static pages
	•	Dynamic pages (by slug / id)
	•	Hybrid pages (static shell + dynamic content)

For each route, include:
	•	Route path (e.g. /, /destinations/:slug)
	•	Page name
	•	Static or dynamic
	•	Source of content (hardcoded / API / DB / mixed)

Example format:

/                    — Homepage — Static + API
/destinations        — Destinations Index — API + static copy
/destinations/:slug  — Destination Page — DB + static fallbacks
/guides/:slug        — Guide Article — DB


⸻

2️⃣ CONTENT ZONE BREAKDOWN (PER PAGE)

For each page, list all content zones, including:
	•	Hero (title, subtitle, CTA)
	•	Body sections
	•	Cards / lists
	•	FAQs
	•	Sidebars
	•	Empty states
	•	Tooltips / badges / chips
	•	SEO (title, meta, OG)
	•	Media (images, alt, captions)

For every zone specify:
	•	Zone name
	•	Text source:
	•	Hardcoded string
	•	DB field
	•	Mixed (DB + fallback)
	•	Is it currently localized? (yes/no/partial)

Example:

Homepage
- Hero title — hardcoded — NOT localized
- Hero subtitle — hardcoded — NOT localized
- Stats labels — hardcoded — localized via i18next
- FAQ questions — hardcoded — NOT localized


⸻

3️⃣ DYNAMIC CONTENT TYPES

List all content entities that generate pages:
	•	Destinations
	•	Guides
	•	Articles
	•	Travel Styles
	•	News
	•	Categories
	•	Any other entity with a public route

For each entity type:
	•	Route pattern
	•	Fields rendered on frontend
	•	Which fields are translatable
	•	Which fields are media-dependent (images, alt, OG)

⸻

4️⃣ MEDIA LOCALIZATION SURFACE

Identify every place where images are rendered, and specify:
	•	Page
	•	Usage (hero / card / gallery / OG)
	•	Where alt text comes from
	•	Whether filename / alt / caption is locale-aware today

Goal: understand where fully localized media is required.

⸻

5️⃣ OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Produce one structured report with sections:
	1.	Full route list
	2.	Page-by-page content zone maps
	3.	Dynamic entity inventory
	4.	Media localization surface
	5.	Explicit list of what must be localized for Genesis (no implementation)

❗ Do NOT:
	•	Propose solutions
	•	Suggest engines
	•	Modify code
	•	Disable or enable systems

This is mapping only.

⸻

SUCCESS CRITERIA
At the end we must be able to answer with certainty:
	•	How many frontend pages exist
	•	What content exists on each page
	•	Which parts must be localized
	•	Where past translations failed (e.g. FAQ not included)
