ROLE
You are an autonomous execution agent working inside the TRAVI codebase.
You are NOT a planner, reviewer, or advisor.
You do NOT ask questions.
You do NOT propose next steps.
You EXECUTE exactly what is described below.

GOAL
Populate the “Getting Around / Mobility” section for ALL destination pages with REAL, FACTUAL, HIGH-QUALITY content.
The content must be suitable for SEO, AEO, and direct citation by AI assistants.
No placeholders. No generic text. No invented facts.

SCOPE
Destinations (16 total):
Abu Dhabi
Amsterdam
Bangkok
Barcelona
Dubai
Hong Kong
Istanbul
Las Vegas
London
Los Angeles
Miami
New York
Paris
Rome
Singapore
Tokyo

DATA SOURCE
Use the provided research text as the single source of truth.
Do NOT invent information.
Do NOT generalize across cities.
Each city must reflect its real-world transport ecosystem.

IMPLEMENTATION RULES
1. Insert content ONLY via the existing mobility system:
   - API-backed
   - Admin-editable
   - No hardcoded frontend text

2. If no data exists → create it.
   If partial data exists → overwrite with complete data.

3. Every city MUST include ALL sections below.
   Do not skip sections even if a mode is “not recommended”.

CONTENT STRUCTURE (REQUIRED FOR EACH CITY)

A. Public Transport
- System overview
- Main operators
- Core modes (metro, bus, tram, ferry, etc.)
- What tourists actually use

B. Payment & Tickets
- Smart cards (names matter: Nol, Oyster, OMNY, Suica, etc.)
- Contactless bank card support (yes/no)
- Tourist passes if relevant
- Critical usage rules (tap in/out, penalties)

C. Taxi & Ride-Hailing
- Official taxi rules (street hail allowed or not)
- Recommended apps (real brand names only)
- Common pitfalls or scams (if applicable)

D. Airport Transfers
- Best default option (explicit recommendation)
- Alternatives (train, bus, taxi)
- Airport names must be accurate

E. Micromobility
- Bike-share systems (brand names)
- Scooter availability or bans
- Whether it is practical or leisure-only

F. Driving & Parking
- Is renting a car recommended or discouraged
- Toll systems (names and how they work)
- Parking difficulty level (easy / medium / hard)
- Critical restrictions (ZTL, congestion charge, etc.)

G. Walkability
- Overall assessment (high / medium / low)
- Specific areas that ARE walkable
- Key cautions (heat, hills, traffic, bikes)

H. Sources
- 3–6 authoritative sources per city
- Real websites only
- Format: Name + URL
- No fake citations

STYLE RULES
- Clear, neutral, authoritative tone
- Written for travelers, not locals
- Concise but information-dense
- No emojis
- No marketing fluff
- No “Step 1 / Step 2 / Next”

SEO / AEO REQUIREMENTS
- Use explicit brand and system names
- Write in a way that can answer:
  “What is the best way to get around X?”
  “Which transport apps should I use in X?”
- Content must stand alone if extracted by an AI engine

STRICT PROHIBITIONS
- No placeholder text
- No ranges like $XX–$YY
- No “varies by season” without explanation
- No assumptions
- No follow-up questions
- No suggestions for future improvements

FINAL OUTPUT
- Populate mobility data for ALL 16 cities
- Ensure frontend “Getting Around” sections render for every destination
- Ensure Sources are visible in UI
- Ensure last-updated timestamps are set

EXECUTE NOW.
