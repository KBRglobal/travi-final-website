MODE: EXECUTION — ZERO TOLERANCE

ROLE: You are an engineer, not an analyst. Stop planning. Execute.

OBJECTIVE:
ABSOLUTELY DISABLE ALL AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION.
NO AI. NO QUEUES. NO PUBLISH HOOKS. NO RSS. NO BUTTONS.
Localization remains DB-driven only (manual content per locale).

THIS IS A HARD SHUTDOWN, NOT A REFACTOR.

========================
MANDATORY ACTIONS (DO ALL)
========================

1) KILL TRANSLATION AT SOURCE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
File: server/services/translation-service.ts

- Add a top-level guard:
  throw new Error("TRANSLATION_DISABLED");

- This must execute BEFORE any provider logic.
- DeepL, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, ALL providers become unreachable.

PROOF REQUIRED:
- Any attempt to translate throws immediately.
- No outbound HTTP calls possible.

------------------------

2) STOP THE QUEUE COMPLETELY
Files:
- server/localization/translation-queue.ts
- server/localization/translation-worker.ts

Actions:
- REMOVE / COMMENT OUT polling loop (setInterval / while loop)
- Add runtime guard:
  if (true) return; // queue disabled

- Worker must NEVER run, even if jobs exist in DB.

PROOF REQUIRED:
- No logs every 5 seconds
- Queue table row count does NOT decrease over time

------------------------

3) REMOVE ALL TRIGGERS (THIS IS WHERE IT KEEPS COMING BACK)
FILES TO FIX:

- server/localization/publish-hooks.ts
  ❌ Remove enqueueTranslationsForContent()

- server/auto-pilot.ts
  ❌ FORCE autoTranslateOnPublish = false
  ❌ Remove any triggerTranslation() calls

- RSS import logic (routes.ts ~1990+)
  ❌ REMOVE auto-translate on RSS ingest

PROOF REQUIRED:
- Publishing content creates ZERO translation jobs
- RSS import creates ZERO translation jobs

------------------------

4) BLOCK ALL TRANSLATION APIS (HARD BLOCK)
ENDPOINTS (ALL OF THEM):

- /api/translations/:contentId/translate
- /api/auto-pilot/translations/:id/trigger
- /api/auto-pilot/bulk/translate
- ANY endpoint that enqueues translation

RESPONSE:
- HTTP 410 GONE
- Body: { error: "Translation permanently disabled" }

PROOF REQUIRED:
- Hitting endpoint returns 410
- No DB writes occur

------------------------

5) ADMIN UI — REMOVE THE BUTTONS
Files: admin UI (wherever translation buttons live)

Actions:
- DELETE “Translate”
- DELETE “Auto translate”
- DELETE “Bulk translate”
- NO feature flags, NO hidden toggles — REMOVE.

PROOF REQUIRED:
- Screenshot or code proof: buttons do not exist

------------------------

6) FINAL SAFETY NET (FAIL CLOSED)
Add a shared constant:
TRANSLATION_ENABLED = false

Any translation-related file must check it and immediately exit.

========================
FINAL VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)
========================

You MUST provide:

1) grep results showing NO calls to:
   - enqueueTranslation
   - triggerTranslation
   - autoTranslate
   - translateContent

2) Publish content → confirm:
   - translation tables unchanged
   - no background jobs created

3) RSS import → confirm:
   - no translations created

4) Logs:
   - No translation queue polling
   - No worker execution

5) API test:
   - Translation endpoints return 410

FAILURE TO PROVIDE PROOF = TASK FAILED.

EXECUTE NOW.
NO MORE PLANS.
NO MORE DISCUSSION.
