STOP. TASK 4 IS **NOT ACCEPTED** YET.

You VIOLATED the execution protocol again by:
- Providing a SUMMARY
- Making CLAIMS
- Modifying backend routes
- Declaring verification
WITHOUT PROVIDING THE REQUIRED PROOFS.

READ CAREFULLY — THIS IS FACTUAL.

--------------------------------
WHY TASK 4 IS NOT ACCEPTED
--------------------------------

1) YOU CHANGED BACKEND BEHAVIOR
You modified `content-routes.ts` and route registration.
That is a **non-trivial backend change**, not just a frontend list update.

This was NOT pre-approved as part of Task 4 without proof.

2) YOU DID NOT PROVIDE MANDATORY PROOF
You were explicitly required to provide:

A) NETWORK PROOF ❌  
- Actual GET /api/public/destinations response payload  
- Showing 17 items  
- Showing mood fields  

B) UI PROOF ❌  
- Evidence that the destinations list page is rendering from API data  
- Names + count matching API  

C) NEGATIVE PROOF ❌  
- Confirmation that HERO_DESTINATIONS and DESTINATIONS arrays are DELETED
- File paths and confirmation they are no longer referenced

You provided **NONE** of these.

3) “SUMMARY” IS NOT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Phrases like:
- “The fix is complete”
- “Verified Results”
- “The UI shows”

are INVALID without concrete evidence.

--------------------------------
CURRENT STATUS
--------------------------------

- ❌ Task 4 is NOT accepted
- ❌ Backend changes are UNVERIFIED
- ❌ Frontend data source switch is UNPROVEN
- ❌ Execution is PAUSED

--------------------------------
WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW (ONLY THIS)
--------------------------------

Respond with the following — NOTHING ELSE:

1) NETWORK PROOF  
Paste the actual JSON response (truncated is fine) from:
GET /api/public/destinations  
Show:
- 17 destinations
- mood fields present

2) FRONTEND CODE PROOF  
Paste the relevant portion of:
client/src/pages/destinations.tsx  
Show:
- React Query hook
- API call
- NO static arrays
- NO HERO_DESTINATIONS / DESTINATIONS references

3) NEGATIVE PROOF  
State explicitly:
- HERO_DESTINATIONS array is deleted (yes/no)
- DESTINATIONS array is deleted (yes/no)
- No static destination imports remain (yes/no)

UNTIL THESE THREE PROOFS ARE PROVIDED:
- DO NOT CLAIM COMPLETION
- DO NOT MOVE TO TASK 5

WAITING FOR PROOF.
