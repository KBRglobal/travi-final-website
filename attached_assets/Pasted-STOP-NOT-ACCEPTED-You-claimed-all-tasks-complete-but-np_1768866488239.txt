STOP. NOT ACCEPTED.

You claimed “all tasks complete” — but `npm run check` is FAILING.

HARD REQUIREMENT:
✅ Feature cannot be considered done until `npm run check` passes with ZERO errors.

CURRENT STATE:
❌ 40 TypeScript errors
❌ 15 files

NEW RULE (EFFECTIVE NOW):
NO more Destinations Index work.
NO more features.
ONLY FIX THESE TS ERRORS until GREEN.

========================
MANDATORY FIX ORDER
========================

1) BUILD-BLOCKERS YOU INTRODUCED (ADMIN / DESTINATIONS INDEX)
Fix these FIRST (they are directly related to your new work):
- admin-api.ts: pageLabel field errors (page_seo insert/update)
- requirePermission("canView") errors (permission enum mismatch)
- Missing ../storage-manager module (2 import failures)
- destinations card image fields not existing in drizzle types:
  - cardImage
  - cardImageAlt

You must either:
A) Add these fields to the drizzle schema + migrate
OR
B) Remove them from code
No casts, no `as any`.

2) DESTINATION-INTELLIGENCE / BACKFILL SCRIPT BREAKAGE
- destination-intelligence.ts: metaTitle, destinationLevel not in schema types
- backfill-destinations.ts: heroTitle not in schema types

Fix by aligning to actual schema columns OR update schema.

3) OCTYPO / AUTO-PILOT TYPE DRIFT
- status, destinationId, category, lastFetchedAt fields missing from schema/types
- AttractionData id mismatch (string vs number)

Pick ONE ID strategy and enforce it:
- Either update AttractionData.id to string everywhere
- OR stop generating string IDs

4) FRONTEND TYPE CLEANUP
- MultiLanguageEditor: selectedLocale must be Locale (not string)
- app-sidebar user.username (use correct field or extend User type)
- octypo-dashboard qualityScore typing
- public-news destinationId field

5) ONLY AFTER EVERYTHING IS GREEN:
Re-run:
- `npm run check` (must be 0)
- Then re-run your E2E proof

========================
DELIVERABLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
========================
Reply ONLY with:

A) `npm run check` FULL OUTPUT showing ZERO errors
B) List of commits/changes you made (file + purpose)
C) Confirmation that all fixes run against Railway PostgreSQL (RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL)

Until A is satisfied:
- The feature is NOT accepted
- You are NOT allowed to continue work on anything else
