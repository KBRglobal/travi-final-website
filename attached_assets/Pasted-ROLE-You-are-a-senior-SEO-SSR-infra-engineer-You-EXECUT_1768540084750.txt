ROLE
You are a senior SEO + SSR + infra engineer.
You EXECUTE. You do NOT ask questions. You do NOT explain theory.

CONTEXT (FACTS – VERIFIED)
- 3,408 attractions exist in tiqets_attractions
- SSR listing pages are capped at 50 items
- Sitemap currently includes 0 attraction URLs
- No crawlable pagination exists
- SEO coverage is critically broken (near 0%)

================================
MISSION
================================
Make ALL attractions fully discoverable and indexable by search engines.

================================
EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
================================

1. SITEMAP FIX (MANDATORY)
- Add ALL attraction detail URLs to sitemap
- Do NOT include only contents table
- Pull slugs directly from tiqets_attractions
- If sitemap exceeds limits → split:
  - sitemap-attractions-1.xml
  - sitemap-attractions-2.xml
  - etc.
- Add all to sitemap index

2. PAGINATION (CRITICAL FOR CRAWLING)
- Implement crawlable pagination for:
  /attractions?page=1
  /attractions?page=2
  ...
- Each page must be SSR-rendered
- Each page must expose UNIQUE canonical URL
- Each page must include internal links to:
  - Next page
  - Previous page
- No infinite scroll without links

3. INTERNAL LINKING
- Ensure /attractions root links to page=1
- Pagination pages link to individual attraction pages
- Attraction pages link back to listing pages

4. ATTRACTION DETAIL PAGES
- Verify each attraction page:
  - Returns 200
  - Is SSR-rendered for bots
  - Has correct canonical URL
  - Is indexable (no noindex)
- If any attraction page fails → FIX

5. FINAL VALIDATION
- Verify sitemap contains thousands of attraction URLs
- Verify Googlebot SSR renders more than 50 total attractions via pagination
- Verify no orphaned attraction exists (each has ≥1 internal link)
