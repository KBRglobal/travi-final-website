You are implementing “Getting Around” (Transport & Mobility) for TRAVI destination pages.

Goal
- Replace all placeholder/lorem in the “Getting Around” section with real, destination-specific mobility data.
- Make the section genuinely useful (operational), consistent across all destinations, and SEO/AEO-friendly.
- No guessing. If a fact is missing, leave it blank and omit that sub-block in UI.

Scope
- Pages: Destination pages at /destinations/:slug (DestinationPageTemplate + the “Getting Around” section/component).
- Destinations: 16 slugs:
  abu-dhabi, amsterdam, bangkok, barcelona, dubai, hong-kong, istanbul, las-vegas, london, los-angeles, miami, new-york, paris, rome, singapore, tokyo

What to build (Architecture)
1) Data Model (DB)
Create a normalized “mobility” structure per destination:
- destination_slug (FK or unique key)
- lastUpdated (timestamp)
- sources (array of { name, url, accessedAt })  // show in UI as “Sources”
- sections (JSON):
  a) publicTransport
     - overview (short)
     - keyModes (array: metro/subway, tram, bus, ferry, commuter rail)
     - payment (stored-value card name, contactless support yes/no, notes)
     - officialApps (array of app names)
     - operationalTips (array of short tips)
  b) taxisRideHailing
     - primaryApps (array)
     - officialTaxiInfo (short)
     - commonRules (e.g., “use meter”, “pickup zones”)
  c) airportTransfers
     - airports (array: { code?, name?, bestDefault, alternatives[], notes })
  d) micromobility
     - bikeShare (name/app/notes)
     - scooters (availability + rules notes)
  e) drivingParking
     - rentCarRecommended (yes/no + when)
     - tolling (system name + how rentals are billed)
     - parkingNotes (short)
  f) walkability
     - walkabilitySummary (short)
     - bestWalkAreas (array)
     - cautions (array)

2) Public API
Expose read-only endpoint:
GET /api/public/destinations/:slug/mobility
- Returns 404 if no mobility data exists (do not return placeholders).

3) Admin Panel
Add a new tab in /admin/destinations/:slug:
Tab name: “Mobility”
- Form editor for the mobility structure above (with repeatable lists)
- Includes “Sources” fields (name + url + accessedAt)
- Save to DB
- Show “Last updated”

4) Frontend UI (Destination Page)
In DestinationPageTemplate:
- Fetch mobility data via TanStack Query from the public API.
- Conditionally render the “Getting Around” section ONLY if mobility data exists.
- UI requirements:
  - Card/grid layout (clean, modern TRAVI)
  - Each subsection collapsible (accordion) with clear icons
  - Only render subsections that have content
  - Add a “Sources” footer within the section (small, clean)
  - Add “Last updated” label

5) SEO/AEO
- Add JSON-LD for the mobility section as an FAQ-style block ONLY if we have curated Q/A entries (optional later).
- For now: ensure semantic headings (H2 for Getting Around, H3 for subsections).
- Avoid price claims. Use operational phrasing (e.g., “Tap-to-pay available”, “stored-value card”, “designated pickup zones”).

Hard Rules (No guessing)
- Do not invent:
  - prices, costs, travel times, distances
  - weather, seasons, safety claims
  - laws/regulations unless explicitly provided in the dataset
- If missing: omit.

Deliverables
- DB migration + model
- Admin tab “Mobility”
- Public API endpoint
- Destination page UI integrated + styled
- Remove all placeholder “Getting Around” content
- Provide a short verification checklist (routes, API 404 behavior, UI conditional rendering)

After implementing the framework, WAIT for me to provide the real mobility data for each destination, then populate the admin or seed the DB with that data.
