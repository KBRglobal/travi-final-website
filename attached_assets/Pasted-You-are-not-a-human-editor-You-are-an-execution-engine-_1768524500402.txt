You are not a human editor. You are an execution engine.

Your task:
Rewrite and enrich the **Getting Around** section for EACH destination using the EXACT data already provided to you (no guessing, no inventing, no placeholders).

GOAL:
Turn factual transport data into **decisive, traveler-ready guidance** that:
- Helps users choose quickly
- Works for SEO + AEO (AI answers)
- Feels like local operational advice, not Wikipedia

GLOBAL RULES (MANDATORY):
1. DO NOT invent prices, ranges, or numbers.
2. DO NOT add new transport modes or apps not explicitly listed.
3. DO NOT ask questions.
4. DO NOT leave anything generic.
5. Everything must be written in clear, professional ENGLISH.
6. Prefer short paragraphs. No marketing language.

FOR EACH CITY, STRUCTURE EVERY SECTION EXACTLY LIKE THIS:

────────────────
PUBLIC TRANSPORT
- Start with **Default choice** (one sentence: what most travelers should use)
- Then **When it works best** (context: areas, trip types)
- Then **When to avoid** (time, crowding, limitations)
- Then **Payment & official apps** (already provided data, rewritten clearly)

────────────────
TAXIS & RIDE-HAILING
- Start with **Best app to use** (from provided list)
- Then **Official taxi rules** (street hail vs app, colors, legality)
- Then **Important local tip** (scams, zones, pickup rules)

────────────────
AIRPORT TRANSFERS
- Start with **Best default option** (who it’s best for)
- Then **Good alternative** (when default is not ideal)
- Mention airport name once, no repetition

────────────────
BIKES & SCOOTERS
- Start with **Whether this is actually useful or not**
- If useful: where + when
- If not ideal: say so clearly
- Mention only systems explicitly provided

────────────────
DRIVING & PARKING
- Clear verdict: Recommended / Not recommended
- One sentence why
- Mention toll systems or restrictions ONLY if already provided

────────────────
WALKABILITY
- One-line summary: walkable / partially / not walkable
- Best walking areas (from data)
- One clear caution if relevant (heat, hills, traffic)

────────────────
SOURCES
- Keep sources as-is
- Do not rewrite URLs
- Just ensure formatting is clean

IMPORTANT STYLE CONSTRAINT:
Write as if ChatGPT itself might later answer:
“What’s the best way to get around <CITY>?”
—and this page should be the best possible source.

EXECUTE THIS FOR **ALL PROVIDED CITIES**.
DO NOT STOP MIDWAY.
DO NOT ASK FOR CONFIRMATION.
