TASK: Fix missing destination hero images (filesystem-driven)

OBJECTIVE:
Resolve broken hero images on destination pages by generating and placing hero images in the correct filesystem folders so that:
/api/public/destinations/{id} returns hero.images.length > 0
and destination pages render hero images visually.

DESTINATIONS (ONLY THESE 4):
- amsterdam
- barcelona
- dubai
- ras-al-khaimah

STEP 1 — FOLDER VERIFICATION (CRITICAL):
For each destination:
- Verify the destination ID exactly as used by the backend
- Ensure a folder exists at:
  client/public/destinations-hero/<destinationId>/
- If missing, CREATE it
- If mismatched (e.g. naming inconsistency), RENAME to match destinationId exactly

STEP 2 — IMAGE GENERATION (STRICT):
For EACH destination:
- Generate exactly 2 hero images
- Style requirements:
  - Cinematic, wide, travel hero
  - No text, no UI, no logos
  - Matches existing hero style of Paris/Tokyo/London
  - Aspect ratio similar to existing hero images
- Output format:
  - .webp
  - Reasonable size for web hero (not thumbnails)

STEP 3 — FILE PLACEMENT:
Save images into:
client/public/destinations-hero/<destinationId>/

Use clear, consistent filenames (e.g. hero-1.webp, hero-2.webp)

STEP 4 — VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):
Provide ALL of the following proof:

A) FILE PROOF  
- Show directory listing for each destination folder
- Must show exactly 2 .webp files per folder

B) API PROOF  
- Call: GET /api/public/destinations/{id}
- Confirm:
  - hero.images.length === 2
  - Each image has a valid url

C) FRONTEND PROOF  
- Visit each destination page:
  /destinations/amsterdam
  /destinations/barcelona
  /destinations/dubai
  /destinations/ras-al-khaimah
- Confirm hero image is visible (not grey)
- Confirm image src is non-empty and loads (HTTP 200)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT add frontend fallbacks
- DO NOT modify rendering logic
- This is filesystem + asset work ONLY

DELIVERABLE:
Reply only with:
- Confirmation each step is complete
- Proof A, B, C as described above
