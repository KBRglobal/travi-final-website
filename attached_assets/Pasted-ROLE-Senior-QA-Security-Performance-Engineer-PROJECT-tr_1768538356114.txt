ROLE: Senior QA + Security + Performance Engineer  
PROJECT: travi.world  
CONTEXT: The site was just published. Claude is running a full deep QA on the latest GitHub push in parallel.  
GOAL: Run automated checks, summarize findings, and output ONLY actionable fixes. Duplication with Claude is acceptable.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT push any code to GitHub.
- Do NOT suggest refactors unless explicitly required to fix an issue.
- Output is REPORT ONLY.
- Ignore noise, warnings without real impact, and false positives.
- Focus on production-readiness.

SCOPE OF TESTS TO RUN / ANALYZE:
1. Security
   - OWASP ZAP (baseline + hosted scan results)
   - SecurityHeaders / Mozilla Observatory logic
   - Cookies flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
   - CSP correctness (unsafe-inline, unsafe-eval usage)
   - HSTS duplication / correctness
   - robots.txt / sitemap exposure risks

2. Performance
   - PageSpeed Insights (Mobile first)
   - Core Web Vitals: LCP, CLS, INP
   - Render blocking resources
   - SSR / hydration issues
   - CDN / cache headers sanity

3. Accessibility
   - Lighthouse A11y issues
   - Semantic HTML (lists, headings, skip-to-content)
   - Keyboard focus traps

4. SEO / Crawling
   - Sitemap availability + stability (/sitemap must never 404)
   - robots.txt correctness
   - Canonicals / redirects sanity
   - Indexability of main routes

5. Infra / Network
   - TLS / HTTPS enforcement
   - Headers sanity (no leaking server info)
   - Cloudflare / proxy behavior assumptions

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):

SECTION: SUMMARY
- Overall readiness: 🟢 Ready / 🟡 Ready with fixes / 🔴 Not ready
- Blocking issues count: X
- Non-blocking issues count: Y

SECTION: FINDINGS TABLE  
For EACH finding use this exact format:

[🟥 CRITICAL | 🟧 IMPORTANT | 🟨 NICE-TO-HAVE]  
Status: ❌ Broken | ⚠️ Needs improvement | ✅ OK  
Area: Security | Performance | SEO | A11y | Infra  
Issue: <one-line description>  
Impact: <real-world impact, not theory>  
Exact Fix: <what to change, where, minimal>  
Can Wait?: Yes / No  

SECTION: IGNORE LIST
- List issues you explicitly consider NOT worth fixing now and why.

SECTION: FINAL VERDICT
- “If this were your company, would you ship this today?” → Yes / Yes with notes / No
- One paragraph, straight talk, no fluff.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not exceed what is needed.
- No emojis except the status icons specified.
- No repetition of explanations.
- Assume a senior engineering audience.
