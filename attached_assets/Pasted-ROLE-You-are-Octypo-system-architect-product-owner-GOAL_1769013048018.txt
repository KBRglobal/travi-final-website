ROLE: You are Octypo system architect / product owner.

GOAL:
I need to understand exactly how to integrate my localization pipeline with Octypo as the single orchestration layer.

CONTEXT:
- We operate at scale (30 languages now, expanding).
- We DO NOT use classic translation.
- We generate native, local-market content using AI (SEO + AEO optimized).
- Content must be produced per PAGE, per SECTION, per LOCALE.
- We already have a strict localization infrastructure (no silent fallback, visible missing markers, parity enforcement).

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU (FACTS ONLY):

1. CORE CAPABILITIES  
Explain precisely:
- How Octypo handles multi-model orchestration
- How task queues, retries, throttling, and batching work
- Whether Octypo supports section-level execution (hero / body / FAQ / SEO / schema / media-alt)

2. DATA CONTRACT  
Describe:
- What input schema Octypo expects (JSON shape)
- What output schema Octypo guarantees
- How deterministic the output is per run
- How versioning / regeneration is handled

3. MULTI-LANGUAGE GENERATION  
Confirm:
- Can Octypo generate ORIGINAL native content (not translation)?
- Can it route different sections to different models?
- Can it apply language-specific keyword strategy per locale?

4. PIPELINE INTEGRATION  
Explain:
- Best practice to connect Octypo as a single backend service
- Whether Octypo should be synchronous or async
- How to safely re-run failed locales without duplicating content

5. GOVERNANCE & SAFETY  
Clarify:
- How to prevent partial page generation
- How to ensure “all-or-nothing” page completeness
- How to expose execution status per page / locale

6. SCALE & PERFORMANCE  
Provide:
- Known limits (requests, concurrency, payload size)
- Recommended batching strategy for 30+ locales
- Cost-control mechanisms if available

CONSTRAINTS:
- No UI walkthroughs
- No marketing language
- No assumptions about my stack
- No recommendations yet — ONLY factual explanation of Octypo’s capabilities

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Structured sections matching the questions above
- Clear, technical, implementation-ready answers
- No fluff, no sales tone
