You are updating the DESTINATION HERO BADGES system.

Current problem:
All destinations show the same generic badges (e.g. “Global Travel Hub”, “Expert Guides”, “Top Rated”), which makes the UI look fake and harms SEO/AEO credibility.

Goal:
Each destination must show 2–3 CITY-SPECIFIC badges that are:
- Fact-based (not marketing fluff)
- Clearly differentiated between cities
- Deterministic (rule-based, not random)
- Reusable across the app

Do NOT invent ratings, reviews, or claims.
Do NOT reuse the same badge text across all cities.

- Structural facts (capital, hub, mega-city, etc.)

### IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Remove any generic badge factory or shared badge constants.
2. Create a per-destination badge config (by destination slug).
3. Render badges ONLY from this config.
4. If a destination is missing config → render NO badges (fail-safe).
5. Do not calculate badges from ratings or mock data.
6. Keep badge styling exactly as-is — change TEXT ONLY.

### ACCEPTANCE CHECK
- Dubai and Paris MUST NOT share the same badges.
- No badge should appear on more than 3 cities total.
- Badges must feel credible if quoted by Google or ChatGPT.

Proceed with implementation.
