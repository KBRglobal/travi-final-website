TASK — CRITICAL FIX: NEW DESTINATION BLOCKED FROM FRONTEND

CONTEXT:
A new destination ("test") was created via Admin.
It EXISTS in Railway PostgreSQL but does NOT appear on the public frontend.

Root causes have already been IDENTIFIED:

BUG 1 — HARDCODED WHITELIST (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)
File: server/routes/public-api.ts
There is a hardcoded ALLOWED_DESTINATION_IDS Set that blocks ANY new destination
from being accessible via the public API.

This violates:
- Database as single source of truth
- Admin-controlled content
- Ability to add destinations without code

BUG 2 — is_active DEFAULT BROKEN
The "test" destination has:
- is_active = false
Even though the schema claims default(true), the Admin create flow results in false.

Because:
- List endpoint filters by is_active = true
- Single endpoint is blocked by whitelist

RESULT:
New destinations are silently excluded from frontend.

--------------------------------
OBJECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
--------------------------------
Fix the system so that ANY destination created via Admin:

- Appears in Admin list
- Appears in GET /api/public/destinations (if is_active = true)
- Appears on /destinations page
- Is accessible via /destinations/{slug}
- Requires NO code changes to be publicly visible

--------------------------------
REQUIRED FIXES (ALL REQUIRED)
--------------------------------

1) REMOVE HARDCODED WHITELIST (MANDATORY)
- Delete ALLOWED_DESTINATION_IDS logic entirely
- Public API must rely ONLY on database state
- Validity = exists in DB + is_active = true

2) FIX is_active DEFAULT AT CREATION
- Ensure Admin create endpoint explicitly sets:
  is_active = true
- Do NOT rely on schema defaults implicitly
- Add validation so Admin cannot create a destination with is_active = null/false unintentionally

3) UPDATE EXISTING TEST DATA
- Update "test" destination:
  is_active = true
- Verify it appears in API and frontend

--------------------------------
MANDATORY VERIFICATION (NO EXCEPTIONS)
--------------------------------

A) SQL PROOF (Railway PostgreSQL)
- Show "test" destination with is_active = true

B) API PROOF
- GET /api/public/destinations includes "test"
- GET /api/public/destinations/test returns destination data

C) FRONTEND PROOF
- "test" appears on /destinations page
- /destinations/test loads successfully

D) NEGATIVE PROOF
- Grep confirms NO remaining whitelist logic in public-api.ts
- No hardcoded destination IDs anywhere in public routing

--------------------------------
FINAL RULES
--------------------------------
- Do NOT add new fallbacks
- Do NOT add new whitelists
- Do NOT patch frontend to hide backend bugs
- Do NOT mark complete without proofs

Fix this FIRST.
Do NOT proceed to schemas, media, or other features until this is fully resolved.
