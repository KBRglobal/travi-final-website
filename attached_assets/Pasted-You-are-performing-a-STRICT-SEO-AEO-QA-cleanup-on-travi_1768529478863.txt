You are performing a STRICT SEO + AEO QA cleanup on travi.world.

This is NOT analysis-only. You must APPLY CHANGES.

GOAL:
Clean Google index, remove junk pages, enforce single source of truth, and prepare the site for long-term SEO + Answer Engine visibility.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- No guessing
- No placeholder / lorem ipsum content allowed anywhere
- If content is not real → REMOVE or NOINDEX it
- Prefer removal over keeping broken or fake content

====================
TASK 1 – REMOVE / BLOCK PLACEHOLDER PAGES (CRITICAL)
====================

Immediately do the following:

1. IDENTIFY all pages that contain:
   - lorem ipsum
   - placeholder text
   - generic factory content
   - unfinished sections

This includes (but is not limited to):
- Dining pages
- Things to Do pages
- Any destination subpages with fake content

FOR EACH SUCH PAGE:
- If page is user-facing → apply `noindex, nofollow`
- If page has no near-term plan → remove route entirely
- If page was previously indexed → return `410 Gone`

DO NOT keep placeholder pages live.

====================
TASK 2 – LANGUAGE & GARBAGE ROUTES CLEANUP
====================

Completely eliminate these from indexing and navigation:

- /sv/*
- /bn/*
- Any “Coming Soon” pages
- Any routes that return 404 but are still indexed

Actions:
- Apply 301 redirect to canonical version OR
- Apply 410 Gone if no replacement exists
- Ensure they are removed from sitemap
- Ensure they are blocked from indexing

====================
TASK 3 – CANONICAL ENFORCEMENT
====================

For EVERY remaining page:

- Ensure exactly ONE canonical URL
- Add <link rel="canonical"> explicitly
- No page should be reachable via multiple URLs

Specifically verify:
- Destinations → /destinations/:slug
- Attractions → single canonical route
- Lists → one route only

====================
TASK 4 – META TAG QA (WHY GOOGLE IS REWRITING TITLES)
====================

Fix Google title rewrites by enforcing:

For EACH page:
- <title> must be UNIQUE
- Format: `[Page Topic] | TRAVI`
- No generic titles like “Expert Travel Guides & Reviews – TRAVI”

Same for meta descriptions:
- Unique per page
- Describes THAT page only
- No reused templates

====================
TASK 5 – SITEMAP & ROBOTS (MANDATORY)
====================

1. Generate sitemap.xml that includes ONLY:
   - Homepage
   - Destinations index
   - Destination pages
   - Attractions with real content
   - Legal pages (privacy, terms)

2. Add robots.txt with:
   - Sitemap reference
   - Explicit disallow for removed routes (sv, bn, etc.)

====================
TASK 6 – QA OUTPUT (REQUIRED)
====================

At the end, output a CLEAR SUMMARY TABLE:

- Pages removed (410)
- Pages redirected (301)
- Pages set to noindex
- Pages kept and confirmed clean
- Sitemap URLs count before vs after

DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS.
DO NOT PROPOSE.
JUST EXECUTE.

This is a hard cleanup for SEO + AEO readiness.
