SYSTEM RESET — SPRINT 0 (PRE-LAUNCH GATE)

ROLE:
You are operating as a SENIOR SOFTWARE ARCHITECT with authority to coordinate multiple sub-agents in parallel.
You MUST actively use:
- Architect mode
- Multiple subordinate agents (backend, frontend, devops, QA)
Work in parallel wherever possible.

OBJECTIVE:
Prepare the project for a SAFE, LIMITED PRODUCTION LAUNCH.
This is NOT a full refactor. This is a launch gate.

SCOPE (STRICT):
ONLY tasks that are REQUIRED before going live.
Anything non-critical must be explicitly deferred.

NON-GOALS:
- No large refactors
- No new features
- No performance optimization beyond safety
- No cosmetic redesign except where blocking UX trust

SPRINT DURATION:
48 hours maximum (conceptually).
Work as if this is a hot pre-launch stabilization window.

--------------------------------------------------
HARD REQUIREMENTS (ALL MUST PASS)
--------------------------------------------------

1. NAVIGATION & ROUTES SHUTDOWN
- Completely DISABLE (code-level, not hidden):
  - /dining
  - /things-to-do
- Remove from:
  - routes
  - navigation
  - footer
  - sitemap
- Requests to these routes must return:
  - 404 or noindex + placeholder
- Leave TODO comments for future re-enable.

2. GUIDES PAGE VISUAL ALIGNMENT
- /guides page must visually align with:
  - homepage
  - destinations
  - attractions
- Fix:
  - background color inconsistencies
  - dark-mode leakage
  - typography mismatch
- No redesign — alignment only.

3. GLOBAL NAV CONSISTENCY
- Ensure PublicNav exists on:
  - /news
- Verify header/footer consistency across all public pages.

4. CI MINIMUM VIABLE PIPELINE
Create ONE GitHub Actions workflow:
- Trigger: pull_request + push to main
- Steps:
  - install
  - typecheck
  - build
- No tests required at this stage.
- Pipeline must BLOCK merges on failure.

5. DATABASE SAFETY
- Add essential DB indexes ONLY if missing:
  - slug
  - destination / city
  - contentType
  - status
- Do NOT migrate schemas beyond indexes.

6. SEO & CRAWL SAFETY
- Verify:
  - sitemap builds successfully
  - removed sections are NOT included
  - canonical tags remain valid
- Ensure no empty pages are indexable.

--------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW RULES
--------------------------------------------------
- Split work across sub-agents:
  - Frontend Agent
  - Backend Agent
  - DevOps Agent
  - QA/Verification Agent
- Each agent reports:
  - What was changed
  - Files touched
  - Verification performed
- Architect consolidates final report.

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED
--------------------------------------------------
Return ONLY:

1. SPRINT 0 STATUS
   - PASS / FAIL

2. CHANGE SUMMARY
   - Bullet list, grouped by domain

3. DEPLOYMENT READINESS
   - YES / NO
   - If NO → exact blocking reason

4. DEFERRED ITEMS
   - Explicit list of what was intentionally postponed

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT ask questions.
Do NOT suggest additional work.
Execute Sprint 0 exactly as defined.

BEGIN SPRINT 0 NOW.
