TASK: Octypo × Localization Pilot (End-to-End, Minimal Scope)

MODE: BUILD (no planning, no refactors outside scope)

OBJECTIVE:
Implement ONE complete localization pilot using Octypo as a native content generator (NOT translation).
Prove a clean, single-language render with full SEO + AEO + Schema compliance.

SCOPE (STRICT):
- 1 entity only (choose ONE):
  • attraction OR destination OR staticPage
- 2 locales only:
  • en (baseline)
  • ar (RTL reference)
- No other locales
- No admin UI
- No batching
- No abstractions “for later”

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- Content is GENERATED natively per locale via Octypo (not translated)
- Page renders in ONE language only (no English leakage in AR)
- If any required section fails → NOTHING is written (all-or-nothing)
- FE renders correctly for:
  • /en/{entity}
  • /ar/{entity}
- Schema + SEO + Images are correct per locale

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (EXECUTE IN ORDER):

1) INPUT CONTRACT
- Define explicit input for the entity (no defaults, no fallbacks):
  • entityType
  • entityId
  • destination (required)
  • locale

Fail hard if destination or locale is missing.

2) OCTYPO GENERATION
- Call Octypo with locale-aware WriterTask
- Generate ALL sections in memory:
  • introduction
  • whatToExpect
  • visitorTips
  • howToGetThere
  • faq
  • answerCapsule
  • metaTitle
  • metaDescription

3) VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Run validators BEFORE any DB write:
- CompletenessValidator (all sections exist)
- LocalePurityValidator:
  • Arabic page must be ≥98% Arabic (excluding proper nouns)
  • No English fallback allowed
- BlueprintValidator (word counts, FAQ count)
- SEO/AEO Validator (answer-first, intent match)

If ANY validator fails → mark job failed, write NOTHING.

4) WRITE PATH (ATOMIC)
If all validators pass:
- Write localized content for the entity (locale-specific fields)
- Write localized meta (title, description)
- Attach localized ImageObject:
  • caption in locale
  • alt text in locale
  • representativeOfPage = true

5) FRONTEND RENDER
- FE consumes localized content ONLY
- No t() fallbacks
- No mixed-language UI
- AR page:
  • lang="ar"
  • dir="rtl"

6) VERIFICATION
Provide evidence:
- URL:
  • /en/{entity}
  • /ar/{entity}
- Confirm:
  • No English text visible on AR page
  • Schema inLanguage matches locale
  • FAQ schema present
  • ImageObject present

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Which entity was used
- Which Octypo engine(s) were used
- Validation results (pass/fail per validator)
- Confirmation that Dubai is NOT injected anywhere unless explicitly the entity

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT generalize
- Do NOT prepare for scale
- Do NOT touch unrelated files
- This is a proof-of-flow, not a framework

START NOW.
