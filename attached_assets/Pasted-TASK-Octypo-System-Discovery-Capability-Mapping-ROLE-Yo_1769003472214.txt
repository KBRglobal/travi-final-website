TASK: Octypo System Discovery & Capability Mapping

ROLE:
You are the Octypo system (or an engineer deeply familiar with it).  
Your task is to explain how Octypo actually works internally so we can decide how to integrate it as a large-scale AI orchestration layer for localization.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT suggest integrations yet.
Do NOT generate code.
Do NOT assume use-cases.
Only describe how Octypo works today.

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER (FULL DETAIL REQUIRED):

1) CORE CONCEPTS
- What is the smallest unit in Octypo?
  (job / task / run / prompt / batch – define precisely)
- What metadata does each unit carry?
- Is state preserved between steps or runs?

2) QUEUE & EXECUTION MODEL
- How does the queue work?
- Does Octypo support:
  - priorities
  - concurrency limits
  - per-engine rate limits
  - retries with backoff
- What execution states exist?
  (e.g. pending / running / waiting / failed / completed / partial)

3) MULTI-ENGINE ORCHESTRATION
- How are AI engines selected?
  - static assignment
  - dynamic routing
  - parallel fan-out
- Can one task run on multiple engines simultaneously?
- How are multiple outputs handled?
  - returned as a list
  - merged
  - scored
  - judged by another model

4) WAITING / HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP
- Can a task pause and wait for:
  - manual approval
  - external input
- Can a task resume later from the same state?

5) OUTPUT & STORAGE
- Where do outputs live?
  - ephemeral
  - persisted
- Can outputs be tagged, versioned, or traced back to:
  engine / prompt / parameters?

6) ERROR HANDLING
- Difference between soft failure vs hard failure
- Can a failed task be rerouted to another engine?
- Is partial success supported?

7) OBSERVABILITY
- What visibility exists per task?
  (logs, timing, engine used, cost, retries)
- Is there a way to audit how a final result was produced?

8) LIMITATIONS (BE HONEST)
- What Octypo CANNOT do well today
- Known bottlenecks or constraints
- Things that require external systems

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Answer each section clearly and explicitly.
No marketing language.
No assumptions about our use case.
Pure system explanation only.
