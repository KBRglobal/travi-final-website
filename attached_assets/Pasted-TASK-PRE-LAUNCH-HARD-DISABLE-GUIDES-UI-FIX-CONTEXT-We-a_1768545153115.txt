TASK: PRE-LAUNCH HARD DISABLE + GUIDES UI FIX

CONTEXT
We are going live.
Some sections are unfinished and must be completely disabled at code level for now.
This is intentional scope reduction for a clean launch.

IMPORTANT
This is NOT a soft hide.
These sections must be unreachable in production.

SECTIONS TO FULLY DISABLE (TEMPORARILY)
- /dining
- /things-to-do

REQUIRED ACTIONS

1. HARD DISABLE ROUTES
- Remove /dining and /things-to-do routes from:
  - server routes / router config
  - client router (wouter / react-router)
- Requests to these paths must return:
  - 404 (preferred) OR
  - redirect to homepage
- Do NOT leave active routes that render empty pages

2. REMOVE FROM ALL DISCOVERY SURFACES
- Remove from:
  - Main navigation (PublicNav)
  - Footer
  - XML sitemap
  - Any internal links
- Verify they do NOT appear anywhere in rendered HTML

3. CODE HYGIENE (IMPORTANT)
- Do NOT delete files or logic
- Keep components, pages, and APIs intact
- Add clear TODO comments:
  // TODO: Re-enable dining after data + UX is ready
  // TODO: Re-enable things-to-do after ingestion pipeline is complete

4. GUIDES PAGE UI FIX (/guides)
- Keep all content and structure
- Align visuals to the rest of the site:
  - Use standard light background (same as /destinations, /attractions)
  - Remove heavy dark overlays / experimental gradients
  - Match typography scale, spacing, and button styles
  - Ensure colors align with site palette (no standalone theme)
- Guides must feel like a first-class native page

5. NEWS PAGE NAVIGATION
- Add <PublicNav /> to /news
- Ensure active state works
- Footer already exists – only top nav is missing

6. SITEMAP FINAL STATE
Sitemap MUST include:
- /
- /destinations
- /hotels
- /attractions
- /guides
- /news

Sitemap MUST NOT include:
- /dining
- /things-to-do

7. FINAL VERIFICATION
- Direct access to /dining and /things-to-do returns 404 or redirect
- No empty pages exist in production
- Navigation is clean and minimal
- Visual consistency across:
  /destinations
  /hotels
  /attractions
  /guides
  /news

DELIVERABLE
- One clean commit
- Short summary:
  - Disabled sections
  - Routes removed
  - UI fixes applied
- Confirmation: READY FOR PRODUCTION PUBLISH

This is a launch-hardening task.
No new features.
No refactors beyond scope.
