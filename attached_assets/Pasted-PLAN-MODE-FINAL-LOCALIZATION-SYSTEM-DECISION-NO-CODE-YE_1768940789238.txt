PLAN MODE — FINAL LOCALIZATION SYSTEM DECISION (NO CODE YET)

CONTEXT
We are moving to FULL site localization for 30 languages.
Scope includes: all static pages, all dynamic pages (destinations, attractions, guides, articles), full SEO (meta/OG/JSON-LD/hreflang), full RTL, and FULL media localization (per-locale image + per-locale filename + per-locale alt/title/caption).
DeepL is disabled due to cost. We want ONE final system, remove everything else.

GOAL
Propose ONE final localization architecture using what already exists in the repo, then produce a deletion/disable list and a minimal set of schema/API/frontend adjustments.
Deliver: a concrete final decision + exact actions list (what to delete, what to keep, what to refactor), then only after approval switch to BUILD.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
1) No automatic translation on publish, no background translation queue, no hidden triggers. Translation/generation must be manual and explicit.
2) Keep i18next + locale router + RTL support (do not replace the i18n framework).
3) English is canonical fallback. Locale-specific content renders if exists, else fallback to English, else render nothing.
4) All dynamic entities must be localized: destination pages, attractions pages, content pages.
5) Media localization must be first-class: localized filename and localized alt/title/caption. Must support per-locale hero, card, gallery, OG image.
6) Sitemap must be per-locale and always use BASE_URL=https://travi.world (never replit dev domains).
7) Keep costs low: prefer manual workflows + optional AI assist (Claude/OpenAI/Gemini) ONLY when manually triggered, never automatic.

TASK: READ-ONLY AUDIT + FINAL DECISION
A) CONFIRM CURRENT BUILDING BLOCKS (facts, with file paths)
- Frontend: i18next + locale router + RTL implementation (what is already good and should stay)
- Backend: contents (canonical), translations table, uiTranslations table, fallback hierarchy
- Existing page_seo system
- Current media storage / public folder conventions

B) CHOOSE THE FINAL SYSTEM (must choose ONE)
Option 1 (Preferred if feasible): Use existing translations table for ALL content localization + add a dedicated Localized Assets table for media:
- translations(contentId, locale, title, metaTitle, metaDescription, blocks, etc.)
- localized_assets(entityType, entityId, locale, usage, src, filename, alt, title, caption, ogImageFlag, updatedAt)

Option 2: Extend translations table with a JSONB media field (hero/card/gallery/og) and DO NOT create a new table.

Pick the best option for our codebase and explain why in 5-8 bullet points.

C) DELETE/DISABLE EVERYTHING NOT NEEDED
Provide an exact checklist of what to REMOVE or HARD-DISABLE (with file paths), specifically:
- translation queue + worker
- publish hooks auto enqueue
- RSS auto-translation
- auto-pilot translation triggers
- all translation endpoints that trigger AI automatically
We still want to KEEP manual admin-controlled “Generate/Translate” actions, but only if explicitly clicked.

D) REQUIRED MINIMAL CHANGES (no code yet, just list)
1) DB schema changes (exact tables/columns/indexes needed)
2) API changes (endpoints to fetch localized pages/content + localized media)
3) Frontend changes (how pages resolve localized content/media + RTL)
4) SEO changes (hreflang, canonical rules, per-locale sitemap, image sitemap)
5) Admin UI changes (where to edit translations + assets per locale, with a “Magic” assist button that ONLY suggests, never auto-publishes)

E) OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
Return ONLY:
1) FINAL DECISION: Option X
2) KEEP LIST (paths)
3) REMOVE/DISABLE LIST (paths)
4) REQUIRED CHANGES LIST (DB/API/FE/SEO/Admin)
5) BUILD SWITCH CRITERIA (what must be true before switching to BUILD)

Do NOT write any code. Do NOT ask questions. If you must assume, make the safest assumption and proceed.

Now execute this audit + final decision.
