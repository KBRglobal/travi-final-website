STOP — THIS IS STILL NOT ACCEPTABLE. PLAN MODE ONLY.

You did NOT follow the required structure.
You REMOVED the two most critical items AGAIN.

This is the THIRD time the same blockers were omitted.
We are NOT moving to Build mode until this is fixed.

READ CAREFULLY. THIS IS EXACT.

--------------------------------
MANDATORY FINAL PLAN STRUCTURE
--------------------------------

You MUST resend the task list EXACTLY in this structure and order.
No paraphrasing. No collapsing. No generalization.

COPY THIS STRUCTURE AND FILL IT — DO NOT IMPROVISE.

1. Ghost Destinations Investigation & Permanent Fix (Severity 1)
   - Identify exact code paths injecting unsupported destinations (e.g. Bali, Sydney)
   - Remove them from seed/import/fallback sources
   - Purge existing DB rows explicitly
   - Add a permanent guard to prevent re-injection
   - Document the guard

2. One-time Migration: Static Destination Data → PostgreSQL
   - Migrate hero, SEO, media paths, mood/theme, summaries
   - Verify DB contains complete data for ALL supported destinations
   - Static files remain read-only during migration

3. Create Public Destinations API (List + Single)
   - Read ONLY from PostgreSQL
   - Filter by is_active=true

4. Update Frontend Destinations List Page
   - Replace static arrays with API calls
   - NO fallback to static data allowed

5. Update Frontend Single Destination Page
   - Replace static data access with API calls
   - Hero, SEO, media, mood must come from DB

6. Remove Admin Destination Sections Tab
   - Remove UI
   - Remove routes
   - Remove dead code

7. Filter Admin Destinations List
   - Show ONLY is_active=true destinations
   - Confirm removed destinations do not reappear

8. Remove ALL Static Destination Files
   - Delete only AFTER migration + frontend switch verified

9. QA — Admin → Frontend Hero Test
   - Change Hero Title in Admin
   - Save
   - Refresh frontend
   - Visually confirm change

10. QA — Admin → Frontend SEO Test
