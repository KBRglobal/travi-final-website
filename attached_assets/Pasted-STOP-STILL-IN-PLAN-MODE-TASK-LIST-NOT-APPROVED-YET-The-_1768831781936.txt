STOP — STILL IN PLAN MODE. TASK LIST NOT APPROVED YET.

The task list you provided is NOT approved as-is.
Before switching to Build mode, you MUST REWRITE the task list with the following corrections and clarifications.

REQUIRED REWRITE — PLANNING VERSION ONLY (NO BUILD):

1) EXPLICIT SOURCE OF TRUTH (MANDATORY)
- State explicitly at the top:
  “PostgreSQL places/destinations table is the ONLY source of truth.”
- Confirm that ALL frontend and admin reads will come from this source ONLY.

2) GHOST CITIES — MUST BE A DEDICATED STEP (SEVERITY 1)
Your list currently says:
- “Remove specific cities from data” ❌ (too vague)

You MUST rewrite this step as:
- Identify exact code path(s) that inject unsupported cities (e.g. Bali, Sydney)
- Remove them from seed / import / fallback sources
- Purge them from DB
- Add a permanent guard to prevent re-injection
- Document the guard

This step must appear BEFORE any migration or data fill.

3) DATA MIGRATION CLARITY
Your items:
- “Fill in place details from files”
- “Remove old static place data”

These are ambiguous.

You MUST clarify:
- Which files (exact paths)
- Whether this is a one-time migration script
- When static data is removed (must be AFTER successful DB backfill + frontend switch)

4) FRONTEND SCOPE MUST BE EXPLICIT
Rewrite:
- “Update places list on website”
- “Update single place page display”

To explicitly state:
- Replace static arrays with API calls
- No fallback to static data allowed
- Loading/error states acceptable, static data is not

5) ADMIN SCOPE MUST BE EXPLICIT
Rewrite:
- “Show only active places for admin”

To include:
- Admin list source
- Filtering logic (is_active=true)
- Confirmation that inactive places are not rendered publicly

6) QA STEPS MUST BE AT THE END AND UNCHANGED
Your last steps are correct, but must explicitly say:
- QA is performed by executing real Admin actions
- Visual verification on public frontend is mandatory
- No report without proof

--------------------------------
REQUIRED OUTPUT FROM YOU (PLAN MODE ONLY)
--------------------------------

Resend the task list rewritten with:
- Explicit sources
- Explicit file paths where relevant
- Explicit order
- No vague verbs

ONLY after that rewrite will approval be granted to switch to Build mode.

DO NOT SWITCH MODES YET.
WAIT FOR APPROVAL.
