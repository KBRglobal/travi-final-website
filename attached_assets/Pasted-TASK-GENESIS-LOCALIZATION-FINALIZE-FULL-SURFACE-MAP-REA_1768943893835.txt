TASK: GENESIS LOCALIZATION — FINALIZE FULL SURFACE MAP (READ-ONLY)

MODE: PLAN ONLY (do NOT build, do NOT modify code)

OBJECTIVE:
Complete and LOCK the Genesis localization inventory so we have a single source of truth for “everything that must be localized” — with zero blind spots and zero partial coverage.

WHAT YOU MUST FINISH (GAPS TO CLOSE):

1) MEDIA & SEO COMPLETENESS
For every route already identified:
- List ALL images that appear (hero, card, gallery, decorative).
- For each image, specify:
  - Source (hardcoded / DB / filesystem / API)
  - Whether ALT text exists
  - Whether ALT text is locale-aware
  - Whether the image itself must be locale-specific (text in image, cultural context)
- Do the same for OG images (per page type).

2) SCHEMA & META LOCALIZATION
Explicitly inventory:
- All Schema.org blocks used (FAQPage, WebSite, Organization, Article, Breadcrumb, etc.)
- For each schema:
  - Which fields contain human language
  - Whether they are currently localized
  - Where the source lives (component vs DB)
This is critical — schema text must match page language.

3) RTL IMPACT MAP
For RTL locales (ar, he, fa, ur):
- Identify components that need layout mirroring or special handling:
  - Nav
  - Carousels
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Icons with directionality
- Mark whether RTL is:
  - Fully handled
  - Partially handled
  - Not handled

4) PAGE → ZONE → ENTITY MATRIX
Produce ONE final matrix:
- Rows = Pages
- Columns = Zones (Hero, Filters, Cards, FAQs, Empty States, SEO, Schema, Media)
- Each cell = Source + Localizable? (YES/NO) + Notes

5) EXCLUSIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Explicitly list what is OUT of Genesis scope (e.g. Tiqets attraction bodies).
- Everything not listed as excluded is IN scope by default.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- One markdown document
- No recommendations
- No implementation
- No opinions
- Facts only

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
If we hand this document to an engineer, they can implement 30-language full localization without discovering a single missing zone later.

Proceed.
