PLANNING FEEDBACK — PLAN IS INCOMPLETE AND NOT ACCEPTABLE AS-IS

STATUS:
This plan is TOO GENERIC and DOES NOT address the core failures that were documented.
It risks repeating the same mistake: building “something new” without fixing the broken source-of-truth problem.

BEFORE THIS PLAN CAN BE APPROVED, IT MUST BE REWRITTEN TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING — IN PLANNING ONLY.

--------------------------------
WHAT IS MISSING FROM THE PLAN
--------------------------------

1) SOURCE-OF-TRUTH EXPLICITNESS (CRITICAL)
Your plan does NOT explicitly state:
- What is the SINGLE source of truth for Destinations
- What existing sources currently exist
- Which ones will be deprecated and removed

You MUST explicitly list:
- Frontend current source(s)
- Admin current source(s)
- Any static / seed / fallback / AI / external sources
- Which ONE becomes authoritative

Without this, “Add destination data to storage” is meaningless.

2) GHOST DESTINATIONS (RECURRING BUG) — NOT ADDRESSED
Your plan does NOT mention:
- Unsupported destinations (Bali, Sydney, etc.)
- The fact that this issue has occurred before
- Investigation of HOW they are being injected

You MUST add a dedicated planning step:
- Trace exact creation path of ghost destinations
- Identify code responsible
- Plan permanent prevention (not just cleanup)

3) FRONTEND CONTENT OWNERSHIP — NOT DEFINED
Your plan mentions:
“Get destination list from new source”
“Get single destination from new source”

But does NOT specify:
- Which frontend sections will switch
- What happens to existing frontend-rendered content
- Whether Hero / Sections / SEO / Mobility are included

You MUST explicitly list:
- Hero content
- Content sections
- Images / Media
- SEO
- Mobility / Transport
and state whether each will:
- Move to Admin control
- Or be removed from Admin entirely

4) ADMIN FEATURES ARE IGNORED
Your plan does NOT mention:
- Broken toggles
- Broken Add Section
- Broken Edit
- Empty Content Sections vs frontend content
- Non-functional SEO tab

These MUST be part of the plan, even if the decision is to REMOVE them.

5) QA IS TOO VAGUE
“Test editing destination visible on frontend” is insufficient.

You MUST define:
- Exact action(s) to test (e.g. change Hero title)
- Exact expected frontend change
- Who performs the test (agent simulating real user)

--------------------------------
REQUIRED PLAN REWRITE (STRUCTURE)
--------------------------------

Rewrite the plan using THIS structure:

1. Current Architecture Mapping
   - List all current data sources for Destinations (Admin + Frontend)
   - Identify conflicts and duplications

2. Source of Truth Decision
   - Declare the single authoritative source
   - List sources to be removed or deprecated

3. Ghost Destinations Investigation
   - Identify exact injection paths
   - Plan prevention mechanism

4. Destination Data Model Scope
   - Explicitly list which fields are managed by Admin
   - Explicitly list which frontend sections are affected

5. Migration Strategy
   - How existing frontend content will be migrated or replaced
   - How to avoid breaking live pages

6. QA Plan (Operator-Based)
   - Exact actions
   - Exact verification steps
   - Frontend confirmation required

--------------------------------
RULE
--------------------------------

DO NOT PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION
until this rewritten plan is reviewed and approved.

This is still PLANNING MODE.
Generic task lists are not sufficient.
