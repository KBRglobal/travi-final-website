PLAN REVIEW — NOT APPROVED YET (NEARLY THERE)

You are CLOSE, but this task list is still missing two CRITICAL planning elements.
Until they are added, we CANNOT switch to Build mode.

WHAT IS GOOD (ACKNOWLEDGED):
- Source of Truth is explicitly declared ✅
- No static data / no fallback rule is clear ✅
- Admin vs Frontend responsibility is implied ✅
- QA steps are present (hero + meta title tests) ✅

WHAT IS MISSING (BLOCKERS):

--------------------------------
1) GHOST DESTINATIONS — SEVERITY 1 (MISSING)
--------------------------------

Your plan DOES NOT mention the recurring issue of unsupported / ghost destinations.

This is NOT optional and NOT implied.
It MUST appear as an explicit, early task.

You MUST add a task that includes ALL of the following:
- Identify the exact code path(s) injecting unsupported destinations (e.g. Bali, Sydney)
- Remove them from seed / import / fallback sources
- Purge existing DB rows explicitly
- Add a permanent guard to prevent re-injection
- Document the guard

Without this step, execution is NOT approved.

--------------------------------
2) DATA MIGRATION STEP IS TOO VAGUE
--------------------------------

You removed:
“Fill in place details from files”

But you did NOT replace it with a clear migration step.

You MUST explicitly include:
- One-time migration from existing static destination files
- Exact intent: backfill hero, SEO, media paths, mood, etc. into DB
- Confirmation that static files are deleted ONLY AFTER successful migration

Right now:
“Delete old static destination data” ❌ is unsafe without migration context.

--------------------------------
REQUIRED FINAL TASK LIST STRUCTURE (PLAN MODE)

Your corrected list MUST look like this (structure-wise):

1. Ghost Destinations Investigation & Removal (Severity 1)
2. One-time Migration: Static Destination Data → PostgreSQL
3. Create Public API for Destinations (list + single)
4. Update Frontend Destinations List Page to API (no fallback)
5. Update Frontend Single Destination Page to API (no fallback)
6. Remove Admin Destination Sections Tab (code + UI)
7. Filter Admin Destinations List to is_active=true
8. Remove ALL static destination files after verification
9. QA: Change Hero Title in Admin → verify frontend
10. QA: Change Meta Title in Admin → verify <title>

--------------------------------
NEXT STEP
--------------------------------

Resend the task list ONE LAST TIME with:
- Ghost destinations step added
- Explicit migration step added
- Order preserved

Once that is done:
You will receive **explicit BUILD AUTHORIZATION**.

DO NOT EXECUTE YET.
WAIT FOR APPROVAL.
