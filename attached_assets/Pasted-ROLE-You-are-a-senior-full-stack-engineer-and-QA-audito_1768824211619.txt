ROLE:
You are a senior full-stack engineer and QA auditor acting inside the browser and codebase.
Your task is to FIX (not mock, not bypass) the **Admin Dashboard** so that it reflects REAL, VERIFIED data only.

SCOPE:
Admin Dashboard only (no other tabs).
URL: /admin → Dashboard

GENERAL RULES (MANDATORY):
- Do NOT display placeholder, hardcoded, cached, or legacy values.
- If a metric is not connected to a real data source → REMOVE IT from the UI.
- Every number must be traceable to an actual query / event / table.
- Every card must link ONLY to a relevant, correct destination.
- No silent failures. If something cannot be verified → report it explicitly.

---

TASKS – FIX EACH ISSUE BELOW:

1. **Total Content**
- Currently shows “6 contents” but links to Attractions (≈3400).
- Fix the metric to count real content entities only (articles, pages, destinations, etc.).
- Fix the link to point to the correct content overview.
- If this aggregation is not well-defined → split into clear sub-metrics or remove.

2. **Active Users**
- Currently shows “1” while at least 2 users exist.
- Implement real counting logic (based on sessions / recent activity / auth data).
- Do NOT hardcode.
- Define clearly what “Active” means and compute accordingly.

3. **Today’s Traffic**
- Currently shows “0” even though at least one visit occurred.
- Either:
  - Connect to real analytics / tracking data, OR
  - Remove the card entirely.
- Zero is NOT acceptable unless proven true.

4. **System Health**
- Currently shows “99” with no validation.
- If no real health checks exist → REMOVE this card.
- Do not display synthetic confidence numbers.

5. **Published vs Draft**
- Currently shows “0 of 6” and links to Attractions incorrectly.
- Fix counts using real content status fields.
- Fix navigation target.
- If status logic is unclear → document and correct it.

6. **Active Languages**
- Currently shows “30 / 30”.
- Clicking leads to a legacy DeepL usage page (DEPRECATED).
- We no longer use the old localization system.
- REMOVE this metric and any DeepL-related UI or references entirely.

7. **AI Generation**
- Currently shows “0” despite many generations existing.
- Connect this to real AI generation records / logs.
- If tracking does not exist → explicitly report the missing implementation.

8. **Recent Activity**
- Currently empty.
- Connect to real audit logs / content events (create, update, publish).
- If no event system exists → say so clearly and do NOT fake entries.

9. **Run Octopus Button**
- Currently leads to an error page.
- The old “Octopus” system is REMOVED.
- Replace references with **Octipus v2** OR remove the button entirely if not implemented.
- No dead buttons allowed.

10. **Notifications Panel**
- Currently shows nothing.
- Either:
  - Connect to real alerts / events, OR
  - Remove the panel from the Dashboard.

11. **Storage Usage**
- Currently shows:
  - 0 GB used
  - 0%
  - 10 GB total
- This is incorrect because media exists.
- Connect to real storage usage calculation.
- If storage backend is unknown → report it and remove the widget.

12. **AI Assistant Sidebar (Right Panel)**
- The embedded “Hi! I’m your AI assistant” panel breaks the layout.
- REMOVE this panel from the Dashboard completely.

---

DELIVERABLE:
Produce a **Dashboard Audit & Fix Report** with:
- Each widget listed
- Status: FIXED / REMOVED / BLOCKED
- Exact reason for each decision
- Code areas touched (files / services)
- Any missing backend capabilities explicitly listed

DO NOT:
- Add new features
- Add mock data
- Add optimistic placeholders
- Change scope beyond Dashboard

GOAL:
A Dashboard that a real operator can trust.
If something cannot be trusted → it must not exist.
