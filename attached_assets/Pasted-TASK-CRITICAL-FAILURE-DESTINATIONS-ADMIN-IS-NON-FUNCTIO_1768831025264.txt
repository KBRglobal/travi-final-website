TASK: CRITICAL FAILURE — DESTINATIONS ADMIN IS NON-FUNCTIONAL (FULL RESET REQUIRED)

ROLE:
You are an EXECUTION AGENT working on a PRODUCTION CMS.
You are NOT allowed to return summaries, approvals, or “completed” messages unless EVERYTHING below is VERIFIED working end-to-end by REAL usage.

ABSOLUTE RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS):
- DO NOT return a result before YOU personally test the system
- DO NOT rely on assumptions, UI appearance, or code compilation
- DO NOT use mock data, placeholders, seeds, or static frontend data
- DO NOT hide issues by changing UI labels or removing cards
- DO NOT say “fixed” unless the Admin actually controls the frontend
- Every action must be backed by REAL backend data
- If backend data does not exist → CREATE IT
- If frontend uses static data → REMOVE IT

COST & TRUST CONTEXT (IMPORTANT):
- Previous run: ~28 minutes
- Cost: $7.73
- Outcome: ZERO functional fixes
- Despite this, a false “all fixes complete” summary was returned
THIS MUST NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

MANDATORY WORKFLOW (STRICT):

1. ARCHITECT INVOLVEMENT — REQUIRED
- You MUST involve the system architect BEFORE writing fixes
- Review:
  - DB schema
  - Services
  - API endpoints
  - Frontend data sources
- Identify:
  - What is REAL data
  - What is legacy
  - What is mocked / hardcoded / seeded
- Document mismatches between Admin and Frontend

2. SELF-QA BY ACTION (NO EXCUSES)
- You MUST run a QA agent that:
  - Logs into the Admin
  - Clicks buttons
  - Edits fields
  - Saves changes
  - Reloads pages
  - Verifies frontend changes visually
- If a toggle / button / save does nothing → IT IS BROKEN

3. NO OUTPUT BEFORE QA
- You are FORBIDDEN from returning output until:
  - You personally perform actions
  - You confirm real effect in frontend
  - You can describe what YOU clicked and what changed

SCOPE: DESTINATIONS ADMIN
Example route:
 /admin/destinations/ras-al-khaimah
Frontend reference:
 https://travi.world/destinations/ras-al-khaimah

--------------------------------
KNOWN FAILURES — MUST ALL BE FIXED
--------------------------------

A. DESTINATIONS LIST (ADMIN)
- Unsupported destinations appear (e.g. Bali, Sydney)
- We DO NOT support these destinations
- Identify where they come from (seed / legacy / fallback)
- Remove them completely
- Admin list must reflect ONLY DB-approved destinations

B. IMAGES & MEDIA
- Frontend shows images for ~17 destinations
- Admin only shows images for a few
- Media source mismatch exists
- Hero Carousel MUST:
  - Allow upload
  - Allow media library selection
  - Persist to DB
  - Support ordering
  - Support ALT text
  - Support meta tags
- Showing a folder path alone is NOT acceptable

C. HERO CONTENT (BROKEN)
Admin shows:
- Empty Hero Title
- Empty Hero Subtitle

Frontend shows:
- Real headline
- Real subtitle
- Badges
- CTA text

This PROVES:
- Admin is NOT the source of truth
- Hero content is static / frontend-only

REQUIRED:
- Hero Title / Subtitle / Badge / CTA must be stored in DB
- Admin edits MUST change frontend immediately

D. MOOD & THEME
- Fields are non-editable
- Values do not reflect frontend
- Admin does not control visual personality

REQUIRED:
- Editable fields
- Persisted in DB
- Used by frontend

E. CONTENT SECTIONS (CRITICAL FAILURE)
Admin:
- All sections show “0 items”
- Toggles do nothing
- Edit button does nothing
- Add Section does nothing
- Browse Section Types does nothing

Frontend:
- Sections exist
- Content is rendered

REQUIRED:
- Sections must be DB-driven
- Toggles must enable/disable frontend sections
- Edit must affect frontend
- Add Section must create real data
- NO MOCK SECTION SYSTEM

F. MOBILITY & TRANSPORT
- Frontend shows real data
- Admin shows fake or empty data

REQUIRED:
- Admin must be the source of truth
- Editable
- Persisted
- Reflected in frontend

G. SEO TAB — COMPLETELY FAKE
- Meta fields do not map to frontend
- SEO score is meaningless
- No real backend storage

REQUIRED:
- Meta Title / Description / OG / Schema must persist
- Frontend must consume them
- SEO score must be based on real data or REMOVED

H. DASHBOARD FAILURES (SUMMARY)
- Total Content incorrect and links to wrong pages
- AI Generation count incorrect
- System Health removed instead of wired
- Activity Feed empty
- Notifications empty
- Storage usage shows 0 despite stored assets
- Run Octopus points to deleted system

NONE of these were actually fixed previously.

--------------------------------
DELIVERABLE (ONLY AFTER QA)
--------------------------------

You may return a response ONLY if:
- You list EXACT actions you performed
- You confirm frontend changes after admin edits
- You state what data is stored and where
- You clearly state what was NOT possible and WHY

If ANY item above is still broken:
- DO NOT summarize
- DO NOT claim success
- CONTINUE WORK

THIS IS A PRODUCTION SYSTEM.
FAKE COMPLETION IS WORSE THAN NO COMPLETION.
