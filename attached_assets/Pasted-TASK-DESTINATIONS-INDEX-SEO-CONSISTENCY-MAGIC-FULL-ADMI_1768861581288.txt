TASK: DESTINATIONS INDEX — SEO, CONSISTENCY, MAGIC & FULL ADMIN CONTROL (CRITICAL)

CONTEXT:
The Destinations system is now DB-backed end-to-end (Admin → Railway PostgreSQL → Public API → Frontend).
Individual destination pages are editable and SEO-controlled.
HOWEVER: the **Destinations INDEX page (/destinations)** and related global elements are NOT fully controllable, NOT SEO-safe, and NOT consistent.

This is unacceptable. SEO is business-critical.

SCOPE (STRICT — NO FEATURE CREEP):
Fix ONLY Destinations Index + Admin control gaps described below.
Do NOT touch Hotels, Guides, Attractions, or unrelated systems.

---

OBJECTIVES (MANDATORY):

1) DESTINATIONS INDEX SEO — FULL ADMIN CONTROL
Add full SEO management for `/destinations`:
- Meta title
- Meta description
- Canonical URL
- OG title
- OG description
- OG image
- Robots directives
- JSON-LD (CollectionPage / ItemList)

RULES:
- No hardcoded values
- No fallbacks
- Railway PostgreSQL is the ONLY source of truth
- Must be editable from Admin (same UX as Page SEO editor)
- Changes must reflect immediately on frontend

---

2) TEXT CONSISTENCY & SEO RULES (INDEX PAGE)
Enforce consistency for destination cards on the index page:

- Title length rule (SEO-safe)
- Description length rule (SEO-safe)
- Line consistency (no mixed 1-line / 2-line randomness)
- Truncation must be deterministic (not CSS guesswork)

VALIDATION:
- Server-side validation
- Clear error messages in Admin
- No silent truncation

---

3) IMAGE CONTROL (NO MANUAL PATHS)
For destination cards + hero carousel:
- Admin must be able to UPLOAD images
- Select / replace images via UI
- Alt text required (SEO)
- Filename normalization (SEO-safe)
- MIME type validation
- No manual path typing
- No “copy file name and paste” workflows

Images must be stored and referenced consistently from DB.

---

4) HERO CAROUSEL — ADMIN CONTROL
For Destinations Index hero:
- Upload images
- Reorder images
- Set alt text per image
- Enable/disable per image
- No static arrays
- No code-defined ordering

---

5) MAGIC BUTTON (MANDATORY)
Add a **Magic** button for the Destinations Index editor:

Magic must:
- Generate SEO-optimized:
  - Meta title
  - Meta description
  - OG title
  - OG description
  - H1 / intro text
- Show SEO score (like single destination page)
- Respect character limits
- Be fully optional (manual override always possible)

NO magic = NO acceptance.

---

6) SCHEMAS EVERYWHERE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Schemas must be:
- Visible in Admin
- Editable without code
- Validated
- Versioned

Required schemas:
- CollectionPage
- ItemList
- BreadcrumbList

No inline hardcoded JSON-LD allowed.

---

7) NEW DESTINATION VERIFICATION (BLOCKER FIX)
When adding a new destination:
- It MUST appear on `/destinations`
- It MUST be editable in all fields
- It MUST inherit index-level SEO rules
- No whitelist logic
- No purge logic
- Only `is_active` controls visibility

Provide proof.

---

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED — NO EXCEPTIONS):
- Code proof (exact files + line ranges)
- DB proof (Railway PostgreSQL)
- API proof
- Frontend proof
- Negative proof (no static arrays, no fallbacks)
- QA steps executed manually (what was clicked, what changed)

---

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
If I can:
- Add a destination
- Upload images
- Edit titles, descriptions, meta, schemas
- Click Magic
- See consistent SEO-safe output
WITHOUT touching code

→ ACCEPTED.

Anything less → REJECTED.
