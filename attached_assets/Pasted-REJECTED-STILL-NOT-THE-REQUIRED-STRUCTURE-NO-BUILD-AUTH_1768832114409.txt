REJECTED — STILL NOT THE REQUIRED STRUCTURE. NO BUILD AUTHORIZATION.

You did NOT submit the task list with the exact required structure.
You replaced required steps with generalized wording again.

This is not a misunderstanding — this is a process violation.

WE ARE STILL IN PLAN MODE.

--------------------------------
WHY THIS IS REJECTED (FACTUAL)
--------------------------------

Your submission:

- Does NOT include:
  - “Ghost Destinations Investigation & Permanent Fix”
  - Explicit mention of Bali / Sydney
  - Seed / import / fallback investigation
  - Permanent guard requirement

- Does NOT include:
  - Explicit “One-time Migration: Static Destination Data → PostgreSQL”
  - What data is migrated
  - Read-only static phase
  - Verification before deletion

- Does NOT preserve:
  - Required step names
  - Required order
  - Required specificity

This means:
You are still abstracting instead of committing to the hard requirements.

--------------------------------
THIS IS THE LAST ACCEPTABLE INPUT FORMAT
--------------------------------

You may NOT rename items. You may NOT shorten them.
