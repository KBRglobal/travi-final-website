TASK: Fix Destinations Admin — REAL DATA, NO MOCKS, NO DEAD UI

SCOPE:
Admin → Destinations
Tested URL: /admin/destinations/ras-al-khaimah
Applies to ALL destinations.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do NOT leave mock / placeholder / frontend-only data.
- Do NOT show “Coming Soon”.
- Do NOT change UI text to hide bugs.
- Everything must be connected to REAL backend data or explicitly disabled and removed.

---

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

1) Missing Images in Destinations List
- Paris, Singapore, Bangkok, Istanbul, Dubai, New York show NO image.
- These destinations DO have images on the frontend.
REQUIRED:
- Find the real image source (hero / thumbnail / media relation).
- Fix the query / relation so images load correctly.
- Remove “empty” state if content exists.

2) “empty” Label Appears Incorrectly
- Admin shows “empty” while frontend has content.
REQUIRED:
- Fix backend field mapping.
- Ensure Admin reflects actual stored content, not frontend fallbacks.

3) Magic Buttons show “Coming Soon”
- Magic buttons are visible but not connected.
REQUIRED:
- Either:
  a) Connect them to real AI endpoints and make them functional, OR
  b) Remove them completely.
- Explain what each Magic button is supposed to do and wire it.

4) Search Behavior is Wrong
- Typing first letter should filter alphabetically.
- Example: typing “a” returns Paris (wrong).
- Abu Dhabi should appear first.
REQUIRED:
- Implement proper search logic:
  - startsWith / prefix-based
  - ordered results
- No random matching.

5) “New Destination” Button Does Not Work
REQUIRED:
- Fix navigation or creation flow.
- Button must open a working creation form or modal.
- No dead buttons.

6) Destination Name Is Not Editable
REQUIRED:
- Enable editing destination name.
- Persist changes to backend.
- Update frontend accordingly.

7) Hero Content (Headline & Subtitle)
- Fields are empty in Admin.
- Content exists on frontend.
REQUIRED:
- Connect Hero Headline & Subtitle to backend fields.
- Ensure Admin pulls real data.
- Ensure edits persist and update frontend.

8) Mood & Theme
- Not editable.
- Does not match frontend.
REQUIRED:
- Connect to backend.
- Enable editing.
- Ensure frontend reflects changes.

9) Content Sections
- Toggle does nothing.
- Edit button does nothing.
- Add Section does nothing.
- Browse Section Types does nothing.
REQUIRED:
- Implement full CRUD for content sections:
  - enable/disable
  - edit
  - add
  - select type
- Or remove the entire section if backend does not exist.

10) Mobility & Transport
- Data exists on frontend.
- No backend data.
REQUIRED:
- Either:
  a) Move this data into backend and connect Admin, OR
  b) Remove Admin section entirely.
- No frontend-only ghost data.

11) SEO Tab Is Fully Non-Functional
- No real data.
- Nothing saved or validated.
REQUIRED:
- Connect SEO fields to backend.
- Persist meta title, description, schema, etc.
- Or remove SEO tab until backend exists.

---

CONCLUSION:
The Destinations Admin section is currently a MOCK.
This is NOT acceptable.

GOAL:
Convert Destinations Admin into a REAL management tool:
- Every field → real backend data
- Every button → works
- No frontend-only illusions

DELIVERABLE:
- List of backend models/fields used per section
- List of endpoints connected
- Explicit list of removed features (only if backend truly missing)
- Confirmation that Ras Al Khaimah works end-to-end, then all destinations inherit it

DO NOT MOVE ON UNTIL:
- ras-al-khaimah is fully editable
- changes reflect on frontend
- zero dead buttons remain
