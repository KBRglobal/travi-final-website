TASK: Eliminate Mixed-Language UI — Enforce Single-Locale Rendering (EN / AR)

CONTEXT:
The app currently renders a MIX of languages on the same page (e.g., Arabic + English / Hebrew fragments).
This is NOT a translation problem — it is a STATE & FALLBACK problem.
Result: parts of the UI are localized, others fall back to default English or legacy literals.

OBJECTIVE (STRICT):
At runtime, EVERY rendered string on a page must come from ONE locale ONLY.
If a translation key is missing → show a clear fallback marker or English consistently — NEVER mix languages.

ROOT CAUSES TO FIX:
1. i18next fallback behavior is leaking English strings.
2. Some components use hardcoded literals instead of t().
3. Some keys exist in one locale JSON but not others.
4. Multiple translation namespaces are partially loaded.
5. Legacy arrays/constants still bypass i18next.
6. RTL pages render LTR fallback text from default namespace.

MANDATORY RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS):
- ZERO hardcoded user-facing strings in JSX.
- ZERO implicit fallbacks to another language.
- ONE active locale per request.
- ONE namespace load per page (validated).
- If key is missing → render "[MISSING_TRANSLATION:key]" visibly.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (DO IN ORDER):
1. i18next CONFIG
   - disable fallbackLng OR set fallbackLng = currentLocale ONLY
   - enable returnNull = false
   - enable returnEmptyString = false
   - enable missingKeyHandler with console + UI marker

2. GLOBAL AUDIT
   - grep for raw strings in /pages and /components
   - remove all legacy constants (arrays, labels, titles)
   - replace EVERYTHING with t()

3. TRANSLATION PARITY CHECK
   - write a script that compares:
     en/common.json vs ar/common.json (and others)
   - fail build if keys mismatch

4. COMPONENT SAFETY WRAPPER
   - create <LocalizedText /> helper
   - forbid direct t() usage without namespace
   - log missing keys with component name

5. PAGE-LEVEL GUARANTEE
   - each page declares:
     const { t } = useTranslation("common")
   - forbid cross-namespace access

6. RTL VALIDATION (AR ONLY)
   - test /ar with:
     hero
     cards
     CTAs
     footer
     FAQ
   - confirm ZERO English words appear

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Visiting /ar shows 100% Arabic OR explicit [MISSING_TRANSLATION:*]
- Visiting /en shows 100% English
- NO page shows mixed languages
- NO silent fallbacks
- NO hardcoded literals remain
- Build fails on missing keys

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Short report: which files were fixed
- Screenshot proof: /en and /ar homepage
- Confirmation: “Mixed-language rendering eliminated”

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT translate content.
Do NOT add new copy.
This task is about CONSISTENCY, not language quality.

START IMMEDIATELY.
