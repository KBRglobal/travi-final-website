STOP. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTED.

You did NOT follow the requested deliverable. You gave a high-level summary with no verifiable inventory, no route list, no file references, no template-by-template zone breakdown, and you even introduced claims like “200+ routes” without proof.

RE-DO THE TASK IN READ-ONLY MODE.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):
Return a single document with 4 sections only:

SECTION A — ROUTES INVENTORY (EXHAUSTIVE)
List EVERY PUBLIC FRONTEND ROUTE pattern that exists in the app (from client routing).
For each route include:
- Route pattern
- Component file path
- Whether it’s static / dynamic
- Notes if it’s destination-scoped or guide-scoped
Exclude ONLY: Tiqets attractions DETAIL pages (but keep attractions index and city listing if they exist).

SECTION B — TEMPLATE ZONE MAP (EXHAUSTIVE)
For EACH template/component in Section A, list ALL content zones, explicitly:
- Hero (title/subtitle/description/badges/CTA)
- Body sections (each block/section)
- Cards (title/description/labels)
- FAQs
- Empty states
- Errors
- SEOHead fields
- Images (hero/gallery/cards/OG)
- alt/title/captions
Do not skip anything. If you are unsure, open the component and enumerate what renders.

SECTION C — SOURCE OF TRUTH PER ZONE
For each zone from Section B, specify exactly:
- Source type: hardcoded | i18next key | DB/API field | derived (computed)
- The exact key/field name (e.g. page_seo.metaTitle, destinationsIndexConfig.heroTitle, t('search.placeholder'))
- Fallback behavior (requested locale → en → empty) if applicable

SECTION D — GAP LIST (ACTIONABLE, FACTUAL)
Only facts:
- Which zones are NOT localizable today and why (missing API fields, hardcoded strings, no locale param, etc.)
- Which zones already support locale (and how)

HARD RULES:
- NO recommendations.
- NO phases.
- NO “high priority/medium priority”.
- NO vague claims (“many pages”, “200 routes”).
- This is an inventory and mapping only.

PROCESS RULE:
You must build Sections A–C directly from the codebase:
- client/src/App.tsx and/or route registry files
- the actual component files referenced by routes
Use grep/search across client/src for routes and SEOHead usage as needed.

DELIVERABLE COMPLETENESS CHECK:
At the end, include a line:
“COVERAGE: X routes listed, Y templates mapped, Z zones enumerated”
where X/Y/Z are actual counts from your output.

NOW DO IT AGAIN, PROPERLY.
