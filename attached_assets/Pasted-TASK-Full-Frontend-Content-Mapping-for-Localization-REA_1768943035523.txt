TASK: Full Frontend Content Mapping for Localization (READ-ONLY)

GOAL:
Create a COMPLETE, EXHAUSTIVE inventory of ALL frontend content that must be localized.
This is NOT implementation. This is analysis + documentation only.

SCOPE (IMPORTANT):
- Include ALL frontend pages, templates, and internal pages
- Include dynamic pages (destinations, guides, travel styles, news, search, etc.)
- Include internal pages per destination and per guide
- EXCLUDE Tiqets attractions detail pages for now
- INCLUDE all content blocks, FAQs, SEO, images, alt text, captions
- INCLUDE static + dynamic content
- INCLUDE RTL considerations
- DO NOT translate anything
- DO NOT change code
- DO NOT build schemas yet

DELIVERABLE:
A structured document that answers:

1) PAGE & TEMPLATE INVENTORY
For each frontend route/template:
- Route pattern (e.g. /destinations/:slug)
- Template/component file
- Instances count (how many pages use this template)
- Whether content is static or DB-driven

2) CONTENT ZONES PER TEMPLATE
For EACH template, list ALL zones explicitly:
Example:
- Hero (title, subtitle, CTA, badges)
- Intro / overview
- Dynamic sections
- FAQs
- Related content
- SEO (title, meta, OG)
- Images (hero, gallery, OG)
- Alt text / captions

3) TRANSLATABILITY AUDIT
For EACH zone:
- Is it currently localized? (YES / PARTIAL / NO)
- Where does the data come from? (hardcoded / DB / config / JSON)
- Known issues (e.g. “FAQ not translated”, “only hero translated”)

4) IMAGE & MEDIA AUDIT
For EACH template:
- What images exist?
- Are images locale-aware today? (YES / NO)
- Is alt text localized? (YES / NO)
- Is filename / semantic meaning locale-dependent?

5) OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a clear, hierarchical structure:
- By template
- Then by zones
- With clear bullet points
No opinions, no solutions, no code.

IMPORTANT:
This mapping will be used to design FULL localization (30 languages, RTL, SEO-perfect).
Assume zero trust in existing translation coverage.
Be paranoid and exhaustive.

START WITH:
Homepage
Destinations Index
Destination Page
Guides Index
Guide Page
Travel Style Page
Attractions Index
Search Page
News Page
Static Pages (About, Contact, Legal)
Global UI (header, footer, empty states)

END RESULT:
A definitive “localization surface map” of the entire frontend.
