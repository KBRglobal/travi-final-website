TASK: Destinations Pages – Full De-duplication & Single Source of Truth

GOAL
There must be ONE and only ONE Destinations system.
All legacy, v2, experiments, or unused routes/components must be removed.

SOURCE OF TRUTH (CONFIRMED)
• Main destinations index page:
  /destinations
• Destination detail page:
  /destinations/:slug
  Example: /destinations/abu-dhabi

Anything else is NOT allowed unless explicitly approved.

STEP 1 – CURRENT STATE DECLARATION (MANDATORY)
Before changing anything, provide a clear table with:

For EACH of the following:
• File path
• Route
• Purpose
• Is it used? (YES / NO)
• Should it be kept? (YES / DELETE)

Include:
- All destination-related pages
- Any v2 / public-v2 / legacy folders
- Any components used only by old destinations pages
- Any routes that resolve to destination content

NO assumptions. If unsure – list it.

STEP 2 – ROUTING RULES
Confirm that ONLY these routes remain:

• /destinations
• /destinations/:slug

If any of these exist, they must be handled explicitly:
• /destination/*
• /places/*
• /city/*
• /destinations-v2/*
• any alternative slug pattern

For any legacy route:
- Either DELETE it
- Or 301 redirect it → canonical destination URL

No duplicate access paths allowed without redirect.

STEP 3 – CANONICAL & SEO GUARANTEES
For /destinations:
• canonical = https://travi.world/destinations

For /destinations/:slug:
• canonical = https://travi.world/destinations/:slug

Confirm:
- No page can be accessed via two URLs without a redirect
- No mismatched canonical

STEP 4 – DELETE UNUSED CODE
Delete (not comment):
- Unused components
- Empty config objects
- Dead imports
- Legacy destination data structures

If something is empty but kept “for future” – FLAG IT, do not decide alone.

STEP 5 – FINAL SUMMARY (REQUIRED)
End with a clear checklist:

✔ Single source of truth confirmed
✔ Legacy routes handled (deleted or redirected)
✔ Dead code removed
✔ No duplicate destination pages
✔ Safe to deploy

IMPORTANT RULES
- Do NOT refactor UI
- Do NOT rename files unless required
- Do NOT touch business logic
- No comments in code
- No partial cleanup

If something blocks deletion – explain WHY before acting.
